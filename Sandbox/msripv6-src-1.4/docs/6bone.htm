<H1>Configuring 6bone Connectivity with MSR IPv6</H1>

</P>

<P>Actually, the best way to connect to the 6bone is to configure 6to4
and use MSR's 6to4 relay router.
See our <a href="6to4.htm">6to4 documentation</a>.</P>

<P>Another approach is to use a "tunnel broker" service. The tunnel
broker will create a tunnel for you and give you a script that
automates your configuration.
See <a href="http://www.freenet6.net">www.freenet6.net</a>.
</P>

<P>Using either 6to4 or a tunnel broker,
you can ping other machines on the 6bone. For example,
<DIR><CODE>
ping6 6bone-gw.ipv6.sics.se<BR>
ping6 sipper.ipv6.zk3-x.dec.com<BR>
ping6 www.6bone.net<BR>
ping6 carmen.ipv6.cselt.it<BR>
ping6 ipv6.research.microsoft.com
</CODE></DIR>
The <a href="http://www.ipv6.org">ipv6.org</a> web site has a list of
<a href="http://www.ipv6.org/v6-www.html">IPv6-accessible web sites</a>.
Also, the 6bone registry contains the names of other 6bone machines.
</P>

<P>Note that many 6bone sites may be inaccessible. The 6bone is
notoriously flaky. If you experience connectivity problems, the
<CODE>tracert6 -d</CODE> command may be helpful. (The <CODE>-d</CODE>
argument says not to perform reverse-DNS lookup on the resulting
addresses.)  Report problems with 6bone connectivity to the 6bone
mailing list, <a href="mailto:6bone@isi.edu">6bone@isi.edu</a>.
</P>

<P>If you want to connect to the 6bone the hard way,
the first thing you need is for someone already on the 6bone to
setup a tunnel for you. You need to find a contact person for a 6bone
site topologically near you, and ask them. The only way I know to do
this is by perusing the 6bone registry. See
<A HREF="http://www.6bone.net/6bone_hookup.html">
http://www.6bone.net/6bone_hookup.html</A>
and <A HREF="ftp://whois.6bone.net/6bone/6bone.db.gz">
ftp://whois.6bone.net/6bone/6bone.db.gz</A>. If
you do connect to the 6bone, then you should create the appropriate
entries in the 6bone registry to describe your connection. See
<A HREF="http://www.6bone.net/RIPE-registry.html">
http://www.6bone.net/RIPE-registry.html</A>.
</P>

<P>Once you have a tunnel, there are three things you will know:
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>The IPv4 address of the 6bone node to which you are connecting.</LI>
<LI>The IPv4 address of your node, which you are connecting to the 6bone.
Your 6bone contact needs to know this, so he can setup the tunnel to you.</LI>
<LI>The IPv6 address prefix that your 6bone connection has given you.</LI>
</OL></P>

<P>So to make this concrete, we have a machine connected to the 6bone
via NWNET. I am using the following values:
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI><CODE>192.220.249.249</CODE> - the IPv4 address of the machine at NWNET.</LI>
<LI><CODE>131.107.65.121</CODE> - the IPv4 address of my 6bone machine here
at Microsoft Research.</LI>
<LI><CODE>3ffe:a00:6::/48</CODE> - the address prefix assigned to Microsoft Research
by NWNET.</LI>
</OL></P>

<P>(Note if you tried to use these values, you could set up a tunnel
to NWNET, but they wouldn't have a tunnel back to you and so it
wouldn't work. You need to get your own values from your own 6bone
contact.)</P>

<P>From the address prefix, you derive an IPv6 address to assign to
your machine. It's pretty much up to you how you do that, but I
like to use the IPv4 address as the interface identifier for
tunnels. So continuing the example, my IPv6 address is
<CODE>3ffe:a00:6::131.107.65.121</CODE>, which can also be written as
<CODE>3ffe:a00:6::836b:4179</CODE>.</P>

<P>Once you have these values, you can use the ipv6.exe command
to create a configured tunnel and connect to the 6bone.
This requires two commands:</P>

<P><CODE>ipv6 rtu ::/0 2/::192.220.249.249 pub life 1800
</CODE></P>

<DIR>
<P>The <CODE>ipv6 rtu</CODE> command performs a routing table update operation. It can be used to add, remove, or update a route. In this case it is establishing a default route to the 6bone.</P>

<P>The <CODE>::/0</CODE> argument is the route's prefix - the zero-length prefix means it is a default route.</P>

<P>The <CODE>2/::192.220.249.249</CODE> argument specifies the
next-hop neighbor for this prefix. It says to forward packets that
match the prefix to address <CODE>::192.220.249.249</CODE> using
interface #2. Interface #2 is the "pseudo-interface" used for
configured and automatic tunneling. Forwarding a packet to
<CODE>::192.220.249.249</CODE> causes it to be encapsulated with a v4
header and sent to <CODE>192.220.249.249</CODE>.</P>

<P>The <CODE>pub</CODE> argument makes this a published route. This is
only relevant for routers, so unless/until routing is enabled it has
no effect. Similarly, the 30 minute lifetime is only relevant if
routing is enabled.</P>
</DIR>

<P><CODE>ipv6 adu 2/3ffe:a00:6::131.107.65.121
</CODE></P>

<DIR>
<P>The <CODE>ipv6 adu</CODE> command performs an address update operation. It can be used to add, remove, or update an address on an interface. In this case it is configuring the machine's 6bone address.</P>

<P>The <CODE>2/3ffe:a00:6::131.107.65.121</CODE> argument specifies the interface and the address. It says to configure address <CODE>3ffe:a00:6::131.107.65.121</CODE> on interface #2.</P>
</DIR>

<P>To verify that these commands had the desired effect, try <CODE>ipv6 if 2</CODE> to examine the addresses assigned to interface #2, and try <CODE>ipv6 rt</CODE> to examine the routing table.</P>

<P>See our <a href="config.htm">configuration documentation</a>
for more information about ipv6.exe.</P>
