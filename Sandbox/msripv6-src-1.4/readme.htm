for the latest version.)</font>

<P>
The information in this file applies to both the source and binary-only
distributions of this release.

<P>
<H3>New for Release 1.4</H3>
The most pervasive change we've made with this release adds full support
for scoped addresses throughout the stack.
This improvement is made visible at user level by the addition of new
scope-aware APIs (e.g. getaddrinfo, getnameinfo) as recommended by the
IETF in RFC 2553.
As an example of these, we have updated the ttcp demonstration program
to be protocol independent.
We've also implemented Nordmark's site-prefixes draft, which allows
site-local addresses to be placed in the DNS.
We support multi-sited nodes.
<P>
<I>Note that since these API changes included the addition of a new
field to the IPv6 socket address structure, <B>binaries from previous
releases will not work with this one.</B> If you have your own
applications, they must be recompiled. The new
<CODE>sin6_scope_id</CODE> field must be initialized; the best way to
do this is to set the entire sockaddr structure to zero before use:
<CODE>memset(&sin6, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_sin6))</CODE>.</I>
<P>
Our syntax for a literal IPv6 address with scope-id is "scope-id/address".
For example, 5/fe80::260:8ff:fe16:6e15 where 5 is an interface index
because it's a link-local address. getaddrinfo parses this syntax.
<P>
Another major stack improvement is Plug and Play and Power Management
support for Windows 2000.  USB and PCMCIA network interfaces can now
be added to or removed from the system on the fly and the stack will
reconfigure itself accordingly.  Similarly, you can disconnect and
reconnect network links or hibernate and resume your system and the
MSR IPv6 stack will do the right thing.  You can even dynamically
unload and reload the stack without rebooting.
<P>
There is a new 6to4cfg program that automates 6to4 configuration.
6to4cfg makes it <EM>very</EM> easy to setup a 6to4 gateway router
and connect your site to the 6bone via 6to4. See our
<a href="docs/6to4.htm">6to4 documentation</a>.
<P>
There are plenty of minor improvements and fixes.
We've improved our support for multicast (MLD) and anycast.
We've implemented the UDP lite proposal.
And we've fixed some problems with our existing correspondent node support
(for mobile IP) and the Network Address and Protocol Translator.
<P>
We've reorganized our header files so that you can build
user-level applications that use IPv6 without needing the SDK or DDK.
Our own source tree still requires the SDK and DDK.
<P>
<H3>Upgrading</H3>
If you currently have a previous release installed, uninstall it before
installing this one.
<P>
To uninstall on NT 4, go to the Control Panel's "Network"
applet (an alternative way to do this is to right-click on "Network
Neighborhood" and select "Properties") and select the "Protocols" tab.
Select the IPv6 Protocol from the list and click "Remove".
<P>
To uninstall on Windows 2000, go to the Control Panel's "Network Connections"
panel (an alternative way to do this is to right-click on "My Network Places"
and select "Properties") and right-click on the "Local Area Connection".
Choose "Properties".  Go to the "General" tab.
Select the IPv6 Protocol and then click on "Uninstall".
Note that the user interface for Windows 2000 differs slightly from beta to
beta, so these instructions are approximate.

<P>
<H3>System Requirements</H3>
Most of our testing has been performed on Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0 with Service
Pack 3 or later installed.
Our implementation <I>should</I> work on NT 4.0 at any Service Pack level;
however, we haven't tested all cases.
For those who are members of the Windows 2000 Beta program, we also work on
Windows 2000 build 1773 or later (this includes all the release candidates and beta versions <I>except</I> Beta 1).
The same binaries that run on NT 4.0 also run on Windows 2000; only the
installation changes.
<P>
If you plan to run our stack on an existing NT 4.0 system, we recommend that
you update it to the latest Service Pack level.
Service Pack updates are available for free download from
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/Support/NTServer/Content/ServicePacks/default.asp" target=_top>
http://support.microsoft.com/Support/NTServer/Content/ServicePacks/default.asp</a>.
<P>
The binary form of this release is only available for the Intel x86
architecture, which is also the only NT-supported platform we've
tested on.
<P>
We currently have support for Ethernet and FDDI interfaces.
Any Ethernet or FDDI card that is supported by NT 4.0 should work
with our release, however, we've only tested about a dozen Ethernet cards
and one FDDI card.
<P>
[If you have the binary-only distribution, you can skip down to
<a href="#Installation">Installation</a>]

<P>
<H3>Building</H3>
The build environment for the source distribution is that provided by the
Microsoft Windows NT Version 4.0 Device Driver Kit (DDK), which in turn
requires a machine with Windows NT 4.0, the Platform Software Development Kit
(SDK) for Win32 and Visual C++ 5.0 (or an equivalent 32-bit C compiler)
installed.
<P>
If you do not have some of these tools and wish to acquire them, you will need
to join Microsoft's Developer Network (MSDN) at the Professional
Subscription level or greater.  Please see
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/default.htm" target=_top>
http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/default.htm</a>
for more information.  Educational institutions may be eligible for special
academic prices, please see your local academic reseller for pricing and
availability.
<P>
Most of our development has occurred on machines running NT 4.0 w/ SP3 or
later, Visual C++ 5.0 or 6.0, Platform SDK of Oct '97, and the NT DDK
Version 4.0.  Having precisely these same versions of the compiler and SDK
shouldn't be necessary; however, we haven't done extensive
testing of other configurations.
<P>
Assuming you have the DDK build environment set up correctly (test by building
one or more of the samples included in the DDK), building our entire tree can
be accomplished simply by running "build" in the msripv6 directory.
To build just a single component, cd to that component's directory and
run build there.
For example, to build the core IPv6 stack, run build in the
<CODE> msripv6\tcpip6</CODE> directory.
The resulting binary is <CODE>tcpip6.sys</CODE>.
<P>
(Build likes to complain about include files that don't end with a blank
line and include files it can't find directly.
You can ignore these messages)

<P>
<H3>Creating an Install Kit</H3>
Once you have successfully built the tree as described above, you can package
up an IPv6 install kit for easy installation of the associated parts.
To do this, go to the <CODE>kit</CODE> subdirectory of msripv6.  Run the
<CODE>mkkit.cmd</CODE> script with the path to an existing directory in
which to place the completed kit as an argument (for example,
"<CODE>mkkit C:\Ipv6Kit</CODE>").

<P>
<a name="Installation"></a>
<H3>Installation on NT 4.0</H3>
The same procedure is used to install either our binary distribution or a
version you built yourself from our source distribution.
Start the Control Panel's "Network" applet (an alternative
way to do this is to right-click on "Network Neighborhood" and
select "Properties") and select the "Protocols" tab.
Click the "Add..." button and then "Have Disk...".
When it asks you for a disk, give it the full pathname to where you downloaded
our binary distribution kit (or where you placed the kit you created yourself
-- in the example above, this was "<CODE>C:\IPv6Kit</CODE>").
IPv6 should now install itself.
<P>
The above install procedure will copy the files from the install kit into the
appropriate places and add entries to the system registry for IPv6
configuration.
If you later modify IPv6 components, you can replace just the
affected file or files without having to uninstall/install IPv6 again.
The protocol stack itself (<CODE>tcpip6.sys</CODE>) is installed in your
<CODE>%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers</CODE> directory.
The Winsock helper dynamically linked library for the INET6 address family
(<CODE>wship6.dll</CODE>) and all the user apps and utilities
(<CODE>ipv6.exe</CODE>, <CODE>ping6.exe</CODE>, <CODE>tracert6.exe</CODE>,
<CODE>ttcp.exe</CODE>, etc) live in the <CODE>%SystemRoot%\system32</CODE>
directory.

<P>
<H3>Installation on Windows 2000</H3>
The same procedure is used to install either our binary distribution or a
version you built yourself from our source distribution.
Note that the user interface for Windows 2000 differs slightly from beta to
beta, so these instructions are approximate.
<P>
Go to the Control Panel's "Network Connections" panel (an alternative way
to do this is to right-click on "My Network Places" and select "Properties")
and right-click on the "Local Area Connection".
Choose "Properties".  Go to the "General" tab.  Click on "Add".
Choose "Protocol" and click on "Add".  Click on "Have Disk...".
When it asks you for a disk, give it the full pathname to where you downloaded
our binary distribution kit (or where you placed the kit you created yourself
-- in the example above, this was "<CODE>C:\IPv6Kit</CODE>").
IPv6 should now install itself.
<P>
Note that unlike NT 4, you do not have to reboot at this point.
IPv6 starts immediately once installed.
<P>
The above install procedure will copy the files from the install kit into the
appropriate places and add entries to the system registry for IPv6
configuration.
If you later modify IPv6 components, you can replace just the
affected file or files without having to uninstall/install IPv6 again.
The protocol stack itself (<CODE>tcpip6.sys</CODE>) is installed in your
<CODE>%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers</CODE> directory.
The Winsock helper dynamically linked library for the INET6 address family
(<CODE>wship6.dll</CODE>) and all the user apps and utilities
(<CODE>ipv6.exe</CODE>, <CODE>ping6.exe</CODE>, <CODE>tracert6.exe</CODE>,
<CODE>ttcp.exe</CODE>, etc) live in the <CODE>%SystemRoot%\system32</CODE>
directory.

<P>
<H3>Configuration</H3>
Our implementation supports stateless address autoconfiguration.
In the common case, you won't need to perform any manual configuration.
At boot time, a link-local address will automatically be assigned to each
network interface.
Global addresses will be assigned based upon receipt of router advertisements.
The default IPSec policy is to allow all traffic to bypass authentication
checks.
<P>
Some manual configuration is required for more advanced features.
We have extra information files describing these
in the <CODE>docs</CODE> subdirectory of the distribution tree.
In particular, we have pages describing how to set up a 
<a href="docs/6bone.htm">connection to the 6bone</a> or a 
<a href="docs/6to4.htm">6to4 gateway</a>, the use of the
<a href="docs/config.htm">ipv6 command</a> to configure interfaces, addresses,
and routing,
and how to <a href="docs/ipsec/readme.htm">configure IP security</a>.

<P>
<H3>Utilities</H3>
We wrote a utility (<CODE>ipv6.exe</CODE>) to retrieve and display various
types of information from the stack.
You can use this to view the state of interfaces, the neighbor cache,
binding cache, destination cache (called the route cache in our
implementation), and the route table.
This utility can also be used to manually configure interfaces,
addresses and route table entries.
<P>
There are also two separate utilities (<CODE>ipsecgui.exe</CODE> and
<CODE>ipsec.exe</CODE>) for configuring IPSec policies and associations.
<P>
Also included with this release are ping6, tracert6, and ttcp.
These work similarly to their v4 counterparts and are installed into
<CODE>%SystemRoot%\system32</CODE> by the above installation procedure.
The ttcp utility now supports IPv4 as well.
We also include mldtest and testsend in the binary distribution, but they
are not installed anywhere by default.
<P>
Implementers may be interested in our hrdtest utility, which generates packets
with various combinations (both legal and not) of IPv6 extension headers.

<P>
<H3>Example Applications</H3>
We've made available (via a separate download file) a version of the
freely available NcFTP client which we've ported to run on our stack.
Please note that this code is <I>not</I> covered by our license, but rather
the author's copyright (as given in the file
"<CODE>COPYRIGHT.h</CODE>" of the NcFTP download).
Also included in the NcFTP download is the pdcurses (public domain curses)
package which is needed to build NcFTP (and is also not covered by our
license).
For more information about building/running NcFTP with our stack, see the
<CODE>readme.msr</CODE> file included in the NcFTP download.
<P>
We've also made available (via a separate download file) a version of
the freely available Fnord! web sever which we've ported to run on our
stack.
Please note that this code is <I>not</I> covered by our license, but rather
the GNU Public License (as given in the file
"<CODE>license.txt</CODE>" of the Fnord download).
For more inforation about building/running Fnord! with our stack, see the
<CODE>readme.msr</CODE> file included in the Fnord download.
<P>
We hope to increase the number of example applications for use with our stack
over time.  We also accept donations.  If you have any freely redistributable
(in both source and binary form) network applications of general interest that
can run on our stack, please let us know.

<P>
<H3>Enabling IPv6 Capability for Microsoft Internet Explorer</H3>
We include a binary of <CODE>wininet.dll</CODE> for NT 4.0 that makes
IE 4.01 SP1 cognizant of IPv6.
In our very brief testing, it appeared to work with IE 5 as well.
<P>
One caveat is that changing your existing <CODE>wininet.dll</CODE> to
our version may break something else; we haven't tested this as
extensively as the real product.
In fact, we've only tested basic web browsing with http and ftp URLS.
We recommend you save your existing version in case you need to back out
of this change.
We only have a modified <CODE>wininet.dll</CODE> for NT 4.0 at the moment;
this will not work on Windows 2000.
<P>
To install, rename your existing <CODE>wininet.dll</CODE> to something else
(e.g. <CODE>wininet.old</CODE>) and copy our <CODE>wininet.dll</CODE> to
<CODE>%SystemRoot%\system32\wininet.dll</CODE> and reboot.  The rename step
is important since you can't overwrite an in-use dll.
<P>
Note you also need the fixes to <CODE>afd.sys</CODE> and (on pre-SP4 systems)
<CODE>msafd.dll</CODE> mentioned below for this to work.
<P>
Internet Explorer understands the RFC 2732 syntax for embedding IPv6 literal
addresses in URLs. For example, http://[2002:836b:4179::836b:4179] as well as
http://ipv6.research.microsoft.com. However, Internet Explorer does not
yet support the use of scope-ids with embedded IPv6 literal addresses.
<P>
<H3>Fixes for NT 4.0</H3>
The following are problems with NT 4.0 that were only exposed by running IPv6.
We include binaries with our release that fix these problems.
We don't want to get in the business of tracking all fixes to NT,
however, so most of our binaries are at the base level of NT 4.0 (i.e. no
Service Packs installed).
Some Service Packs also include new versions of some or all of these binaries,
which presumably fix other problems (and not these).
In other words, if you already have one or more Service Packs installed,
installing these binaries may break something else.
For this reason, these binaries are not installed automatically along with
IPv6 and instead must be installed by hand.
You get to decide if the fix is worth the risk.
<P>
The good news it that most of these problems have since been fixed in
Service Pack 4 (and later) for NT 4.0 and in Windows 2000.
<P>
There is protocol specific code in <CODE>afd.sys</CODE> to which we had to
add an IPv6 case.
Rename your existing version to something else and copy our
<CODE>afd.sys</CODE> (for NT 4.0 with SP3 or less) or <CODE>afd.sp4</CODE>
(for NT 4.0 SP4 or later) to <CODE>%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\afd.sys</CODE>
and reboot. <I>This is fixed in Windows 2000.</I>
<P>
The Winsock getsockname call on AF_INET6 sockets triggers a bug in
<CODE>msafd.dll</CODE> related to the longer addresses.
If you decide you wish to fix this (see warning above), rename your existing
<CODE>%SystemRoot%\System32\msafd.dll</CODE> to something else and replace it
with the one we've included in this release.
This fix is required for most ftp clients to work properly.
<I>This is fixed in SP4 (and later) and in Windows 2000.</I>
<P>
The nslookup utility will incorrectly print the results of a AAAA record query
(some parts of the address are byte-swapped).
If you decide you wish to fix this (see warning above), replace your existing
<CODE>%SystemRoot%\System32\nslookup.exe</CODE> with the one we've included
in this release.
<I>This is fixed in SP4 (and later) and in Windows 2000.</I>

<P>
<H3>Known Issues with our Stack</H3>
Most of the Ethernet interface cards we have tried "just worked".
In two cases, however, we had to update the drivers to the latest versions
available in order to get them to work with our code (we suspect they had
problems with multicast that weren't tickled by the IPv4 stack).
If you experience an immediate crash upon booting with the IPv6 stack
installed, check with your card's manufacturer to ensure that you have
the latest driver.
<P>
Our IPv6 TCP implementation doesn't have all the post-NT 4.0 fixes and
improvements that Microsoft has since shipped in the Service Packs
and in Windows 2000.
<P>
If you are configuring a router that should forward packets
to/from 6to4, configured tunnels, or automatic tunnels,
then you must enable forwarding on all 6over4 interfaces.
<P>
There is a bug in Windows 2000 name resolution that causes the following
problem. If your machine has a v6 address in the DNS, and you try to
look it up on the machine itself (eg lookup "aname" while running on aname),
then the IPv6 name resolution will fail. (The problem has to do with Netbios
name resolution getting in the way.) Qualifying the name (for example
using "aname.acompany.com") works around the bug.
<P>
Our DNS resolver code understands A and AAAA records but not A6 records. The
resolver only uses IPv4 packets to communicate with DNS servers; it
can not run over IPv6 even when it is looking up AAAA records. We do
not support Dynamic DNS updates.
<P>
<H3>Mailing List</H3>
We have set up a mailing list for interested parties to use in
exchanging information regarding their experiences working with our
implementation.  We will also be making interim announcements
regarding the state of our implementation to this list.  To join, send
an email message to <a href="mailto:listserv@list.research.microsoft.com">
listserv@list.research.microsoft.com</a> containing the text<BR>
<DIR><CODE>subscribe msripv6-users <I>yourfirstname yourlastname</I></CODE></DIR>

<P>
<H3>Daily Code Drops</H3>
We make a daily code drop available to those developers who want more
timely source updates.
Naturally, these drops aren't as polished as our quasi-quarterly releases.
If this is something that interests you, drop us a line at the email
address below.
