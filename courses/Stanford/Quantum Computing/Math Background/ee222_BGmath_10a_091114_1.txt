Matrices are an extremely useful and convenient way to work with linear algebra. We can rewrite
linear equations very compactly with matrices. And we can use matrices to set up very general
procedures for solving such equations.
We're going to start here by reminding ourselves what linear equations are and how we write
them using matrices. Then we will look at the general way of solving linear equations
with matrices. A key concept that helps us use matrices in linear algebra is the determinant.
We will remind ourselves of this idea. And how we can use it at least for simple cases.
Finally, we're going to look at the important idea of eigenvalues and eigenvectors with
matrices. The concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is central to quantum mechanics. Essentially,
the eigenvectors will correspond to our ideas of quantized states, and the eigenvalues to
the values of quantities, such as energies, associated with those states. Understanding
how those work with matrix algebra is, therefore, going to be essential and also very useful.
