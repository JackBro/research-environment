Building on our basic understanding of functions, we're now going to introduce various other
functions, including the various powers and related ideas such as reciprocals, square
roots, and quadratic equations. Then we're going to look at logarithms and exponentials.
And we'll finish with the important concept of complex numbers.
Now the ideas of imaginary and complex numbers may seem very abstract, but they turn out
to be very useful. And we use them because they actually make our lives a lot simpler.
We cannot even begin to describe quantum mechanics without these ideas.
