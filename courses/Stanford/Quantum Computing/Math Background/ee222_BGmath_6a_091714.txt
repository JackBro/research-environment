Now that we've introduced the ideas of derivatives for functions of one variable, we need to
extend those to functions of more than one variable. For example, the height of some
hill is clearly a function of two directions, you might be thinking, a kind of north-sound
direction and a kind of east-west direction, on a map that's flat, and the hill is here.
So we need to extend the ideas about derivatives to being able to think about slopes in multiple
different directions, and curvatures in multiple different directions. And that brings us to
the idea of what are called partial derivatives. We're going to introduce those here, and also
some of the basic manipulations we can use with them, so we can handle all of those.
