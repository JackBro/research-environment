1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
OK, this is the second lecture
on determinants.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There are only three.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
With determinants it's a
fascinating, small topic inside

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
linear algebra.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Used to be determinants were
the big thing,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and linear algebra was the
little thing,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but they --
those changed,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that situation changed.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now determinants is one
specific part,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
very neat little part.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And my goal today is to find a
formula for the determinant.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It'll be a messy formula.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So that's why you didn't see it
right away.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But if I'm given this n by n
matrix

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
then I use those entries to
create this number,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
the determinant.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So there's a formula for it.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
In fact, there's another
formula, a second formula using

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
something called cofactors.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So you'll -- you have to know
what cofactors are.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And then I'll apply those
formulas for some,

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
some matrices that have a
lot of zeros away from the

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
three diagonals.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
OK.
So I'm shooting now for a
formula for the determinant.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You remember we started with
these three properties,

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
three simple properties,
but out of that we got all

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
these amazing facts,
like the determinant of A B

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
equals determinant of A times
determinant of B.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But the three facts were -- oh,
how about I just take two by

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
twos.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,160
I know, because everybody here
knows, the determinant of a two

32
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,110
by two matrix,
but let's get it out of

33
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,000
these three formulas.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
OK, so here's my,
my two by two matrix.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,800
I'm looking for a formula for
this determinant.

36
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,000
a b c d, OK.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So property one,
I know what to do with the

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
identity.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Right?
Property two allows me to
exchange

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
rows, and I know what to do
then.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So I know that that determinant
is one.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Property two allows me to
exchange rows and know that this

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
determinant is minus one.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And now I want to use property
three to get everybody,

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
to get everybody.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And how will I do that?

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
OK.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So remember that if I keep the
second row the same,

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm allowed to use linearity in
the first row.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And I'll just use it in a
simple way.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll write this vector a b as a
0 + 0 b.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So that's one step using
property three,

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
linearity in the first row
when the second row's the same.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,590
OK.

55
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,220
But now you can guess what I'm
going to do next.

56
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll -- because I'd like to --
if I can make the matrices

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
diagonal, then I'm clearly
there.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So I'll take this one.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now I'll keep the first row
fixed and split the second row,

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
so that'll be an a 0 and I'll
split that into a c 0 and,

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
keeping that first row the
same, a 0 d.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I used, for this part,
linearity.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And now I'll -- whoops,
that's plus because I've got

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
more coming.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This one I'll do the same.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll keep this first row the
same

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and I'll split c d into c 0 and
0 d.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
OK.
Now I've got four easy
determinants,

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and two of them are -- well,
all four are extremely easy.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Two of them are so easy as to
turn into zero,

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
right?

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Which two of these determinants
are zero right away?

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The first guy is zero.

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,540
Why is he zero?

75
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,000
Why is that determinant
nothing, forget him?

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, it has a column of zeros.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And by the -- well,
so one way to think is,

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
well, it's a singular matrix.

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh, for, for like forty-eight
different reasons,

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
that
determinant is zero.

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's a singular matrix that has
a column of zeros.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's, it's dead.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,510
And this one is about as dead
too.

84
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,000
Column of zeros.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
OK.
So that's leaving us with this
one.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Now what do I -- how do I know
its determinant,

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,440
following the rules?

88
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, I guess one of the
properties that we actually got

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
to was the determinant of that
-- diagonal matrix,

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
then -- so I,
I'm finally getting to that

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
determinant is the a d.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And this determinant is what?

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What's this one?

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Minus -- because I would use
property two to do a flip to

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
make it c b, then property three
to factor out the b,

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
property c to factor out the c
-- the property again to factor

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
out the c, and that minus,
and of course finally I got the

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
answer that we knew we would
get.

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But you see the method.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You see the method,
because it's method I'm looking

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
for here, not just a two by two
answer but the method of doing

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
-- now I can do three by threes
and four by fours and any size.

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,850
So if you can see the method of
taking each row at a time -- so

104
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,000
let's -- what would happen with
three by threes?

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Can we mentally do it rather
than I write everything on the

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
board for three by threes?

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So what would we do if I had
three by threes?

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I would keep rows two and three
the same and I would split the

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
first row into how many pieces?

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Three pieces.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'd have an A zero zero and a
zero B

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
zero and a zero zero C or
something for the first row.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So I would instead of going
from one piece to two pieces to

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
four pieces, I would go from one
piece to three pieces to -- what

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
would it be?

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Each of those three,
would, would it be nine?

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,090
Or twenty-seven?

118
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh yeah, I've actually
got more steps,

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
right.
I'd go to nine but then I'd
have another row to straighten

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
out, twenty-seven.

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes, oh God.
OK, let me say this again then.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
If I -- if it was three by
three, I would -- separating out

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
one row into three pieces would
give me three,

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
separating out the second row
into three pieces,

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
then I'd be up to nine,
separating out the third row

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,570
into its three pieces,
I'd be up to twenty-seven,

127
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,000
three cubed,
pieces.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But a lot of them would be
zero.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So now when would they not be
zero?

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,600
Tell me the pieces that would
not be zero.

131
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,390
Now I will write the non-zero
ones.

132
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,000
OK, so I have this matrix.

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I think I have to use these,
start using these double

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
symbols here because otherwise I
could never do n by n.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
OK.
OK.
So I split this up like crazy.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
A bunch of pieces are zero.

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Whenever I have a column of
zeros, I know I've got zero.

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
When do I not have zero?

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,970
When do I have -- what is it
that's like these guys?

140
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,000
These are the survivors,
two survivors there.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So my question for three by
three is going to be what are

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
the survivors?

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
How many survivors are there?

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What are they?

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And when do I get a survivor.

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, I would get a survivor --
for example, one survivor will

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
be that one times that one times
that one, with all zeros

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
everywhere else.

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,690
That would be one survivor.
a one one zero zero zero a two

150
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,620
two zero zero zero a three
three.

151
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,000
That's like the a d survivor.

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Tell me another survivor.

153
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What other thing -- oh,
now here you see the clue.

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Now can -- shall I just say the
whole clue?

155
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That I'm having -- the
survivors have one entry from

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,910
each row and each column.

157
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,000
One entry from each row and
column.

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Because if some column is
missing,

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
then I get a singular matrix.

160
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And that, that's one of these
guys.

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
See, you see what happened with
-- this guy?

162
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Column one never got used in 0
b 0 d.

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So its determinant was zero and
I forget it.

164
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,390
So I'm going to forget those
and

165
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:45,000
just put -- so tell me one more
that would be a survivor?

166
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,580
Well -- well,
here's another one.

167
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,000
a one one zero zero -- now OK,
that's used up row -- row one

168
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
is used.
Column one is already used so
it better be zero.

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What else could I have?

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Where could I pick the guy --
which column shall I use in row

171
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
two?
Use column three,
because here if I use column --

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
here I used column one and row
one.

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
This was like the column --
numbers were one two three,

174
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
right in order.

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Now the column numbers are
going to

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
be one three,
column three,

177
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and column two.

178
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So the row numbers are one two
three, of course.

179
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The column numbers are some --
OK, some permutation of one two

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
three, and here they come in the
order one three two.

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,340
It's just like having a
permutation matrix with,

182
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,000
instead of the ones,
with numbers.

183
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And actually,
it's very close to having a

184
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
permutation matrix,
because I, what I do eventually

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
is I factor out these numbers
and then I have got.

186
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So what is that determinant
equal?

187
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I factor those numbers out and
I've

188
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
got a one one times a two two
times a three three.

189
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And what does this determinant
equal?

190
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, now tell me the,
this -- I mean,

191
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
we're really getting to the
heart of these formulas now.

192
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What is that determinant?

193
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
By the laws of -- by,
by our three properties,

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I can factor these out,
I can factor out the a one one,

195
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
the a two three,
and the a three two.

196
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
They're in separate rows.

197
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,540
I can do each row separately.

198
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,000
And then I just have to decide
is that plus sign or is that a

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,590
minus sign?

200
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,000
And the answer is it's a minus.

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,020
Why minus?

202
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:52,000
Because these is one row
exchange to get it back to the

203
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
identity.

204
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So that's a minus.

205
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Now I through?

206
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,530
No, because there are other
ways.

207
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,000
What I'm really through with,
what I've done,

208
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
what I've, what I've completed
is only the part where the a one

209
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
one is there.

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But now I've got parts
where it's a one two.

211
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And now if it's a one two that
row is used, that column is

212
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,000
used.
You see that idea?

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I could use this row and
column.

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Now that column is used,
that column is used,

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and this guy has to be here,
a three three.

216
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And what's that determinant?

217
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's an a one two times an a
two one times an a three three,

218
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and does it have a plus or a
minus?

219
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
A minus is right.

220
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,680
It has a minus.

221
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,000
Because it's one flip away from
an id- from the,

222
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
regular, the right order,
the diagonal order.

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And now what's the other guy
with a --

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
with, a one two up there?

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I could have used this row.

226
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I could have put this guy here
and this guy here.

227
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Right?

228
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You see the whole deal?

229
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Now that's an a one two,
a two three,

230
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
a three one,
and does that go with a plus or

231
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
a minus?

232
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yeah, now that takes a minute
of thinking, doesn't it,

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
because one row exchange
doesn't get it in line.

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So what is the answer for this?

235
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Plus or minus?

236
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Plus, because it takes two
exchanges.

237
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I could exchange rows one and
three and then two and three.

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,630
Two exchanges makes this thing
a plus.

239
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:43,000
OK.

240
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And then finally we have --
we're going to have two more.

241
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Zero zero a one three,
a two one zero zero,

242
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
zero a three two zero.

243
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,320
And one more guy.

244
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,000
Zero zero a one three,
zero a two two zero,

245
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
A three one zero zero.

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And let's put down what we get
from those.

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
An a one three,
an a two one,

248
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and an a three two,
and I think that one is a plus.

249
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And this guys is a minus
because one exchange would put

250
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
it -- would order it.

251
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And that's a minus.

252
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
All right, that has taken one
whole board just to do the three

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
by three.

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But do you agree that we now
have a formula for the

255
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
determinant which came from the
three properties?

256
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And it must be it.

257
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And I'm going to keep that
formula.

258
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That's a famous --
that three by three formula is

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,860
one that if, if the cameras will
follow me back to the beginning

260
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,000
here, I, I get the ones with the
plus sign are the ones that go

261
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
down like down this way.

262
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And the ones with the minus
signs are sort of the ones that

263
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
go this way.

264
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I won't make that precise.

265
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
For two reasons,
one, it would clutter up the

266
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
board, and second reason,
it wouldn't be right for four

267
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,000
by fours.
For four by four,
let me just say right away,

268
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
four by four matrix -- the,
the cross diagonal,

269
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
the wrong diagonal happens to
come out with a plus sign.

270
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Why is that?

271
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
If I have a four by four matrix
with ones coming on the counter

272
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
diagonal, that determinant is
plus.

273
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Why?
Why plus for that guy?

274
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,080
Because if I exchange rows one
and four and then I exchange

275
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,000
rows two and three,
I've got the identity,

276
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and I did two exchanges.

277
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So this down to this,
like, you know,

278
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
down toward Miami and down
toward LA stuff is,

279
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
like, three by three only.

280
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,000
OK.
But I do want to get now -- I
don't want to go through this

281
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
for a four by four.

282
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I do want to get now
the general formula.

283
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,790
So this is what I refer to in
the book as the big formula.

284
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:49,000
So now this is the big formula
for the determinant.

285
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,740
I'm asking you to make a jump
from two by two and three by

286
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,000
three to n by n.

287
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
OK, so this will be the big
formula.

288
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
That the determinant of A is
the sum

289
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,750
of a whole lot of terms.

290
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,900
And what are those terms?

291
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,000
And, and is it a plus or a
minus sign, and I have to tell

292
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
you which, which it is,
because this came in -- in the

293
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
three by three case,
I had how many terms?

294
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Six.

295
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And half were plus and half
were minus.

296
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
How many terms are you figuring
for four by four?

297
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
If I get two terms in the two
by two case, three -- six terms

298
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
in the three by three case,
what's that pattern?

299
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
How many terms in the four by
four case?

300
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Twenty-four.

301
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Four factorial.

302
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Why four factorial?

303
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,790
This will be a sum of n
factorial terms.

304
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,000
Twenty-four,
a hundred and twenty,

305
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
seven hundred and twenty,
whatever's after that.

306
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,000
OK.
Half plus and half minus.

307
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And where do those n factorial
--

308
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
terms come from?

309
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
This is the moment to listen to
this lecture.

310
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Where do those n factorial
terms come from?

311
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They come because the first,
the guy in the first row can be

312
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
chosen n ways.

313
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And after he's chosen,
that's used up that,

314
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
that column.

315
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So the one in the second row
can be chosen n minus one ways.

316
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And after she's chosen,
that second column has been

317
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,000
used.
And then the one in the third
row can be chosen n minus two

318
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:53,000
ways, and after it's chosen --
notice how I'm getting these

319
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
personal pronouns.

320
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But I've run out.

321
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And I'm not willing to stop
with three by three,

322
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
so I'm just going to write the
formula down.

323
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,570
So the one in the first row
comes from some column alpha.

324
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,000
I don't know what alpha is.

325
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And the one in the -- I
multiply that by somebody in the

326
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,500
second row that comes from some
different column.

327
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,000
And I multiply that by somebody
in the third row who comes from

328
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
some yet different column.

329
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And then in the n-th row,
I don't know what -- I don't

330
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
know how to draw.

331
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Maybe omega,
for last.

332
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And the whole point is then
that -- that those column

333
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,140
numbers are different,
that alpha, beta,

334
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,000
gamma, omega,
that set of column numbers is

335
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
some permutation,
permutation of one to n.

336
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It, it, the n column numbers
are each used once.

337
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And that gives us n factorial
terms.

338
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And when I choose a term,
that means I'm choosing

339
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
somebody
from every row and column.

340
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And then I just -- like the way
I had this from row and column

341
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
one, row and column two,
row and column three,

342
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
so that -- what was the alpha
beta stuff in that,

343
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
for that term here?

344
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Alpha was one,
beta was two,

345
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
gamma was three.

346
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The permutation was,
was the trivial permutation,

347
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
one two three,
everybody in the right order.

348
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,260
You see that formula?

349
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,000
It's -- do you see why I didn't
want to start with that the

350
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
first day, Friday?

351
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'd rather we understood the
properties.

352
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Because out of this formula,
presumably I could figure out

353
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,760
all these properties.

354
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,030
How would I know that the
determinant of the identity

355
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,000
matrix was one,
for example,

356
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
out of this formula?

357
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Why is -- if A is the identity
matrix, how does this formula

358
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
give me a plus one?

359
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You see it, right?

360
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Because, because almost all the
terms are zeros.

361
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Which term isn't zero,
if, if A is the identity

362
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
matrix?

363
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Almost all the terms are zero
because almost all the As are

364
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,000
zero.
It's only, the only time I'll
get something is if it's a one

365
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
one times a two two times a
three three.

366
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Only, only the,
only the permutation that's in

367
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
the right order will,
will give me something.

368
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It'll come with a plus sign.

369
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,700
And the determinant of the
identity is one.

370
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,000
So, so we could go back from
this formula and prove

371
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,000
everything.
We could even try to prove that
the

372
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
determinant of A B was the
determinant of A times the

373
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
determinant of B.

374
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
But like next week we would
still be working on it,

375
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
because it's not -- clear from
-- if I took A B,

376
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,000
my God.
You know --.

377
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The entries of A B would
be all these pieces.

378
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,250
Well, probably,
it's probably -- historically

379
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,640
it's been done,
but it won't be repeated in

380
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,000
eighteen oh six.

381
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
OK.

382
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It would be possible probably
to see, why the determinant of A

383
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
equals the
determinant of A transpose.

384
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That was another,
like, miracle property at the

385
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
end.

386
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That would, that would,
that's an easier one,

387
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
which we could find.

388
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,000
OK.
Is that all right for the big
formula?

389
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,360
I could take you then a,
a typical -- let me do an

390
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,000
example.

391
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Which I'll just create.

392
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'll take a four by four
matrix.

393
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'll put some,
I'll put some ones in and some

394
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
zeros in.

395
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,000
OK.
Let me -- I don't know how many
to

396
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,000
put in, to tell the truth.

397
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I've never done this before.

398
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,930
I don't know the determinant of
that matrix.

399
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:08,000
So like mathematics is being
done for the first time in,

400
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
in front of your eyes.

401
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
What's the determinant?

402
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Well, a lot of -- there are
twenty-four terms,

403
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
because it's four by four.

404
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Many of them will be zero,
because I've got all those

405
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
zeros there.

406
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Maybe the whole determinant is
zero.

407
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I mean, I -- is that a singular
matrix?

408
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That possibility definitely
exists.

409
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I could, I could,
So one way to do it would be

410
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
elimination.

411
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Actually, that would probably
be a fairly reasonable way.

412
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I could use elimination,
so I could use -- go back to

413
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
those properties,
that -- and use elimination,

414
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
get down, eliminate it down,
do I have a row of zeros at the

415
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,550
end of elimination?

416
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,000
The answer is zero.

417
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I was thinking,
shall I try this big formula?

418
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
OK.

419
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Let's try the big formula.

420
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
How -- tell me one way I can go
down the matrix,

421
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
taking a one,
taking a one from

422
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
every row and column,
and make it to the end?

423
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So it's -- I get something that
isn't zero.

424
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Well, one way to do it,
I could take that times that

425
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
times that times that times
that.

426
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
That would be one and,
and, and I just said,

427
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
that comes in with what sign?

428
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Plus.
That comes with a plus sign.

429
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Because, because that
permutation -- I've just written

430
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the permutation about four three
two one, and one exchange and a

431
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
second exchange,
two exchanges puts it in the

432
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
correct order.

433
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Keep walking away,
don't....

434
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
OK, we're executing a
determinant

435
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
formula here.

436
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Uh as long as it's not
periodic, of course.

437
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
If he comes back I'm in -- no.

438
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
All right, all right.

439
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
OK, so that would give me a
plus one.

440
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
All right.

441
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Are there any others?

442
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Well, of course we see
another one here.

443
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
This times this times this
times this strikes us right

444
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,000
away.
So that's the order three,
the order -- let me make a

445
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,000
little different mark here.

446
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Three two one four.

447
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And is that a plus or a minus,
three two one four?

448
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Is that, is that permutation a
plus

449
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,780
or a minus permutation?

450
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,000
It's a minus.

451
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
How do you see that?

452
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
What exchange shall I do to get
it in the right order?

453
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
If I exchange the one and the
three I'm in the right orders,

454
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
took one exchange to do it,
so that would be a plus -- that

455
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
would be a minus one.

456
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And now I don't know if
there're any more here.

457
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Let's see.
Let me try again starting with
this.

458
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Now I've got to pick somebody
from -- oh yeah,

459
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
see, you see what's happening.

460
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
If I I start there,
OK, column three is used.

461
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So then when I go to next row,
I can't use that,

462
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I must use that.
Now columns two and three are
used.

463
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
When I come to this row I must
use that.

464
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And then I must use that.

465
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
So if I start there,
this is the only one I get.

466
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And similarly,
if I start there,

467
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,280
that's the only one I get.

468
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,000
So what's the determinant?

469
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
What's the determinant?

470
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Zero.
The determinant is zero for
that case.

471
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,760
Because we, we were able to
check the

472
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,000
twenty-four terms.

473
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,630
Twenty-two of them were zero.

474
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,000
One of them was plus one.

475
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
One of them was minus one.

476
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Add up the twenty-four terms,
zero is the answer.

477
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,000
OK.
Well, I didn't know it would be
zero, I -- because I wasn't,

478
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
like, thinking ahead.

479
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I was a little scared,
actually.

480
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I said, that,
apparition went by.

481
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So and I don't know if the
camera caught that.

482
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So whether the rest of the
world will realize that I was in

483
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
danger or not,
we don't know.

484
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,820
But anyway, I guess he just
wanted to be sure

485
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,000
that we got the right answer,
which is determinant zero.

486
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And then that makes me think,
OK, the matrix must be,

487
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
the matrix must be singular.

488
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And then if the matrix is
singular, maybe there's another

489
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
way to see that it's singular,
like find something in its null

490
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
space.

491
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Or find a combination of the
rows that gives zero.

492
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And like what d- what,
what combination of those rows

493
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
does give zero.

494
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Suppose I add rows one and rows
three.

495
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
If I add rows one and rows
three, what do I get?

496
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I get a row of all ones.

497
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Then if I add rows two and rows
four I get a row of all ones.

498
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So row one minus row two plus
row three minus row four is

499
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
probably the zero row.

500
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's a singular matrix.

501
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And I could find something in
its null space the same way.

502
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That would be a combination of
columns that gives zero.

503
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
OK, there's an example.

504
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,930
All right.

505
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,000
So that's, well,
that shows two things.

506
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
That shows how we get the
twenty-four terms and it shows

507
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
the great advantage of having a
lot of zeros in there.

508
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,980
OK.

509
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:54,000
So we'll use this big formula,
but I want to pick -- I want to

510
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
go onward now to cofactors.

511
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Onward to cofactors.

512
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,620
Cofactors is a way of breaking
up this big formula that

513
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:11,000
connects this n by n -- this is
an n by n determinant that we've

514
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,080
just have a formula for,
the big formula.

515
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,000
So cofactors is a way to
connect this n by n determinant

516
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
to,
determinants one smaller.

517
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
One smaller.

518
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And the way we want to do it is
actually going to show up in

519
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,000
this.
Since the three by three is the
one that we wrote out in full,

520
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
let's, let me do this three by
-- so I'm talking about

521
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
cofactors, and I'm going to
start again with three by three.

522
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And I'm going to take the,
the exact formula,

523
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
and I'm just going to write it
as a one one -- this is the

524
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
determinant I'm writing.

525
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm just going to say a one one
times what?

526
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
A one one times what?

527
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And it's a one one times a two
two a three three minus a two

528
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
three a three two.

529
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Then I've got the a one two
stuff times something.

530
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And I've got the a one three
stuff times something.

531
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Do you see what I'm doing?

532
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm taking our big formula and
I'm saying, OK,

533
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
choose column -- out of the
first row,

534
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
choose column one.

535
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And take all the possibilities.

536
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And those extra factors will be
what we'll call the cofactor,

537
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
co meaning going with a one
one.

538
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So this in parenthesis are,
these are in,

539
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,810
the cofactors are in parens.

540
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:06,000
A one one times something.

541
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And I figured out what that
something was by just looking

542
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
back -- if I can walk back here
to the, to the a one one,

543
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
the one that comes down the
diagonal minus the one that

544
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
comes that way.

545
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,760
That's, those are the two,
only two that used a one one.

546
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,000
So there they are,
one with a plus and one with a

547
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,000
minus.
And now I can write in the --
I could look back and see what

548
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
used a one two and I can see
what used a one three,

549
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
and those will give me the
cofactors of a one two and a one

550
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,000
three.
Before I do that,
what's this number,

551
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
what is this cofactor?

552
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,130
What is it there that's
multiplying a one one?

553
00:31:55,130 --> 00:32:01,000
Tell me what a two two a three
three minus a two three a three

554
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,570
two is, for this -- do you
recognize that?

555
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:11,000
Do you recognize -- let's see,
I can -- and I'll put it here.

556
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
There's the a one one.

557
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
That's used column one.

558
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,640
Then there's --
the other factors involved

559
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,000
these other columns.

560
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
This row is used.

561
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
This column is used.

562
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So this the only things left to
use are these.

563
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And this formula uses them,
and what's the,

564
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
what's the cofactor?

565
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,330
Tell me what it is because you
see it, and then --

566
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:50,000
I'll be happy you see what the
idea of cofactors.

567
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,390
It's the determinant of this
smaller guy.

568
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:59,000
A one one multiplies the
determinant of this smaller guy.

569
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That gives me all the a one one
part of the big formula.

570
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You see that?

571
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
This, the determinant of this
smaller guy is a two two a

572
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
three three minus a two three a
three two.

573
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
In other words,
once I've used column one and

574
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
row one, what's left is all the
ways to use the other n-1

575
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
columns and n-1 rows,
one of each.

576
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
All the other -- and that's the
determinant of the smaller guy

577
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
of size n-1.

578
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So that's the whole idea of
cofactors.

579
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And we just have to remember
that with determinants we've got

580
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
pluses and minus signs to keep
straight.

581
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Can we keep this next one
straight?

582
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Let's do the next one.

583
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
OK, the next one will be when I
use a one two.

584
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'll have left --
so I can't use that column any

585
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,000
more, but I can use a two one
and a two three and I can use a

586
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
three one and a three three.

587
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
So this one gave me a one times
that determinant.

588
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
This will give me a one two
times this determinant,

589
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,000
a two one a three three minus a
two three a three one.

590
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So that's all the stuff
involving a one two.

591
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,460
But have I got the sign right?

592
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:38,000
Is the determinant of that
correctly given by that or is

593
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
there a minus sign?

594
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,540
There is a minus sign.

595
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,000
I can follow one of these.

596
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
If I do that times that times
that, that was one that's

597
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
showing up
here, but it should have showed

598
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
-- it should have been a minus.

599
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,910
So I'm going to build that
minus sign into the cofactor.

600
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:04,000
So, so the cofactor -- so I'll
put, put that minus sign in

601
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,140
here.

602
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,000
So because the cofactor is
going to be strictly the thing

603
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
that multiplies the,
the factor.

604
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
The factor is a one two,
the cofactor is this,

605
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,430
is the parens,
the stuff in parentheses.

606
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,000
So it's got the minus sign
built in.

607
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And if I did -- if I went on to
the third guy,

608
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
there w- there'll be this and
this, this and this.

609
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And it would take its
determinant.

610
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It would come out plus
the determinant.

611
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So now I'm ready to say what
cofactors are.

612
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So this would be a plus and a
one three times its cofactor.

613
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And over here we had plus a one
one times this determinant.

614
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
But and there we had the a one
two times its cofactor,

615
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,000
but the -- so the point is the
cofactor is either plus or

616
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
minus the determinant.

617
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So let me write that underneath
them.

618
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
What is the,
what are cofactors?

619
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The cofactor if any number aij,
let's say.

620
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
This is, this is all the terms
in the,

621
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
in the big formula that involve
aij.

622
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
We're especially interested in
a1j, the first row,

623
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
that's what I've been talking
about, but any row would be all

624
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
right.

625
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
All right, so -- what terms
involve aij?

626
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So --
it's the determinant of the n

627
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
minus one matrix -- with row i,
column j erased.

628
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,230
So it's the,
it's a matrix of size n-1 with

629
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:02,860
-- of course,
because I can't use this row or

630
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,000
this column again.

631
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
So I have the matrix all there.

632
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
But now it's multiplied
by a plus or a minus.

633
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
This is the cofactor,
and I'm going to call that cij.

634
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Capital, I use capital c just
to, just to emphasize that these

635
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
are important and emphasize that
they're, they're,

636
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
they're different from the
(a)s.

637
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,000
OK.
So now is it a plus
or is it a minus?

638
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Because we see that in this
case, for a one one it was a

639
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
plus, for a one two I -- this is
ij -- it was a minus.

640
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
For this ij it was a plus.

641
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
So any any guess on the rule
for plus or minus when we see

642
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
those examples,
ij equal one one or one three

643
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
was a plus?

644
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It sounds very like i+j odd or
even.

645
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:12,000
That, that's doesn't surprise
us, and that's the right answer.

646
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So it's a plus if i+j is even
and it's a minus if i+j is odd.

647
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So if I go along row one and
look at the cofactors,

648
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I just take those determinants,
those one smaller determinants,

649
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and
they come in order plus minus

650
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
plus minus plus minus.

651
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
But if I go along row two and,
and, and take the cofactors of

652
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
sub-determinants,
they would start with a minus,

653
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
because the two one entry,
two plus one is odd,

654
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
so the -- like there's a
pattern plus minus plus minus

655
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,000
plus if it was five by
five, but then if I was doing a

656
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:12,000
cofactor then this sign would be
minus plus minus plus minus,

657
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
plus minus plus -- it's sort of
checkerboard.

658
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,000
OK.
OK.
Those are the signs that,
that are given by this rule,

659
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,000
i+j even or odd.

660
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And those are built
into the cofactors.

661
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
The thing is called a minor
without th- before you've built

662
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
in the sign, but I don't care
about those.

663
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,020
Build in that sign and call it
a cofactor.

664
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,000
OK.

665
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So what's the cofactor formula?

666
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
What's the cofactor formula
then?

667
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Let me come back to this board
and

668
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
say, what's the cofactor
formula?

669
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Determinant of A is -- let's go
along the first row.

670
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,000
It's a one one times its
cofactor, and then the second

671
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,000
guy is a one two times its
cofactor, and you just keep

672
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,000
going to the end of the row,
a1n times its cofactor.

673
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So that's cofactor for --
along row one.

674
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And if I went along row I,
I would -- those ones would be

675
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Is.
That's worth putting a box
over.

676
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
That's the cofactor formula.

677
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Do you see that -- actually,
this would give me another way

678
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I could have started the whole
topic of determinants.

679
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And some, some people might do
it

680
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
this -- choose to do it this
way.

681
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Because the cofactor formula
would allow me to build up an n

682
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
by n determinant out of n-1
sized determinants,

683
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
build those out of n-2,
and so on.

684
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,990
I could boil all the way down
to one by ones.

685
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:23,000
So what's the cofactor formula
for

686
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
two by two matrices?

687
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Yeah, tell me that.

688
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
What's the cofactor for us?

689
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Here is the,
here is the world's smallest

690
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
example, practically,
of a cofactor formula.

691
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
OK.

692
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Let's go along row one.

693
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I take this first guy
times its cofactor.

694
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
What's the cofactor of the one
one entry?

695
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
d, because you strike out the
one one row and column and

696
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
you're left with d.

697
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Then I take this guy,
b, times its cofactor.

698
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
What's the cofactor of b?

699
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Is it c or it's --
minus c, because I strike out

700
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
this guy, I take that
determinant, and then I follow

701
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
the i+j rule and I get a minus,
I get an odd.

702
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
So it's b times minus c.

703
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
OK, it worked.

704
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Of course it,
it worked.

705
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And the three by three works.

706
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So that's the cofactor formula,
and that is,

707
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
that's an -- that's a good
formula to know,

708
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and now I'm feeling like,
wow, I'm giving you a lot of

709
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
algebra to swallow here.

710
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Last lecture gave you ten
properties.

711
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Now I'm giving you -- and by
the way, those ten

712
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
properties led us to a formula
for the determinant which was

713
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
very important,
and I haven't repeated it till

714
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
now.

715
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
What was that?

716
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
The, the determinant is the
product of the pivots.

717
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
So the pivot formula is,
is very important.

718
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
The pivots have all this
complicated

719
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
mess already built in.

720
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
As you did elimination to get
the pivots, you built in all

721
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
this horrible stuff,
quite efficiently.

722
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Then the big formula with the n
factorial terms,

723
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
that's got all the horrible
stuff spread out.

724
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And the cofactor formula is
like in between.

725
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It's got easy stuff times
horrible stuff,

726
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
basically.

727
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But it's, it shows you,
how to get determinants from

728
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
smaller determinants,
and that's the application that

729
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I now want to make.

730
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,700
So may I do one more example?

731
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,000
So I remember the general idea.

732
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
But I'm going to use this
cofactor

733
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,000
formula for a matrix -- so here
is going to be my example.

734
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,400
It's -- I promised in the,
in the lecture,

735
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,000
outline at the very beginning
to do an example.

736
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And let me do -- I'm going to
pick tri-diagonal matrix of

737
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
ones.

738
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,010
I could, I'm drawing here the
four by four.

739
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,000
So this will be the matrix.

740
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I could call that A4.

741
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,930
But my real idea is to do n by
n.

742
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,000
To do them all.

743
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So A -- I could -- everybody
understands what A1 and A2 are.

744
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah.

745
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,630
Maybe we should just do A1 and
A2 and A3 just for -- so this is

746
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:58,000
A4.

747
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
What's the determinant of A1?

748
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,090
What's the determinant of A1?

749
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:07,000
So, so what's the matrix A1 in
this formula?

750
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,640
It's just got that.

751
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,000
So the determinant is one.

752
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
What's the determinant of A2?

753
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So it's just got this two by
two,

754
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
and its determinant is -- zero.

755
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And then the three by three.

756
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Can we see its determinant?

757
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Can you take the determinant of
that three by three?

758
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Well, that's not quite so
obvious, at least not to me.

759
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Being three by three,
I don't know -- so here's a,

760
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
here's a good example.

761
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
How would you do that three by
three determinant?

762
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
We've got, like,
n factorial different ways.

763
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Well, three factorial.

764
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
So we've got six ways.

765
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,000
OK.
I mean, one way to do it --
actually the way I would

766
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
probably do it,
being three by three,

767
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I would use the complete the
big formula.

768
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I would say,
I've got a one from that,

769
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I've got a zero from that,
I've got a zero from that,

770
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
a zero from that,
and this direction is a minus

771
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,010
one,
that direction's a minus one.

772
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:11,000
I believe the answer is minus
one.

773
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Would you do it another way?

774
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Here's another way to do it,
look.

775
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Subtract row three from -- I'm
just looking at this three by

776
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,000
three.
Everybody's looking at the
three by three.

777
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Subtract row three from row
two.

778
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Determinant doesn't change.

779
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,440
So those become zeros.

780
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,000
OK, now use the cofactor
formula.

781
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
How's that?

782
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
How can, how -- if this was now
zeros and I'm looking at this

783
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
three by three,
use the cofactor formula.

784
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Why not use the cofactor
formula along that row?

785
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Because then I take that number
times its cofactor,

786
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:59,000
so I take this number -- let me
put a box around it -- times its

787
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,970
cofactor, which is the
determinant of that and that,

788
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,000
which is what?

789
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
That two by two matrix has
determinant one.

790
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So what's the cofactor?

791
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
What's the cofactor of this guy
here?

792
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Looking just at this three by
three.

793
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
The cofactor of that one is
this determinant,

794
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
which is one times negative.

795
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So that's why the answer came
out minus one.

796
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,590
OK.

797
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,000
So I did the three by three.

798
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I don't know if we want to try
the four by four.

799
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Yeah, let's -- I guess that was
the point of my example,

800
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
of course, so I have to try it.

801
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Sorry, I'm in a good mood
today, so you have to stand for

802
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,590
all the bad jokes.

803
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:49,000
OK.

804
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
OK.

805
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,950
So what was the matrix?

806
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:53,000
Ah.

807
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
OK, now I'm ready for four by
four.

808
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Who wants to -- who wants to
guess the, the -- I don't know,

809
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,000
frankly, this four by four,
what's, what's the determinant.

810
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I plan to use cofactors.

811
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
OK, let's use cofactors.

812
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
The determinant of A4 is -- OK,
let's use cofactors on the

813
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
first row.

814
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,770
Those are easy.

815
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:28,000
So I multiply this number,
which is a convenient one,

816
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
times this determinant.

817
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
So it's, it's one times the,
this three by three

818
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
determinant.

819
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Now what is -- do you recognize
that matrix?

820
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,000
It's A3.
So it's one times the
determinant of A3.

821
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Coming along this row is a one
times this determinant,

822
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
and it goes with a plus,
right?

823
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And then we have this one.

824
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And what is its cofactor?

825
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Now I'm looking at,
now I'm looking at this three

826
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
by three, this three by three,
so I'm looking at the three by

827
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
three that I haven't X-ed out.

828
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,120
What is that -- oh,
now it, we did a plus or a --

829
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,000
is it plus this determinant,
this three by three

830
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
determinant, or minus it?

831
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It's minus it,
right, because this is -- I'm

832
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
starting in a one two position,
and that's a minus.

833
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
So I want minus this
determinant.

834
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
But these guys are X-ed out.

835
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,000
OK.
So I've got a three by three.

836
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Well, let's use cofactors
again.

837
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Use cofactors of the column,
because actually we could use

838
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
cofactors of columns just as
well as rows,

839
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,640
because, because the transpose
rule.

840
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,000
So I'll take this one,
which is now sitting in the

841
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
plus position,
times its determinant -- oh!

842
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Oh, hell.
What -- oh yeah,
I shouldn't have said hell,

843
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
because it's all right.

844
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,000
OK.
One times the determinant.

845
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
What is that matrix now that
I'm taking the,

846
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
this smaller one of?

847
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Oh, but there's a minus,
right?

848
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,400
The minus came from,
from the fact that this was in

849
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,000
the one two position and that's
odd.

850
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:20,000
So this is a minus one times --
and what's -- and then this one

851
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
is the upper left,
that's the one one position in

852
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
its matrix, so plus.

853
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And what's this matrix here?

854
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Do you recognize that?

855
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
That matrix is -- yes,
please say it -- A2.

856
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And we -- that's our formula
for any case.

857
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,810
A of any size n is equal to the
determinant of A n minus one,

858
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:53,000
that's what came from taking
the one in the upper corner,

859
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
the first cofactor,
minus the determinant of A n

860
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
minus two.

861
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
What we discovered there is
true for all n.

862
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I didn't even mention it,
but I stopped taking cofactors

863
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
when I got this one.

864
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Why did I stop?

865
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Why didn't I take the cofactor
of this guy?

866
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Because he's going to get
multiplied by zero,

867
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
and no, no use wasting time.

868
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Or this one too.

869
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
The cofactor,
her cofactor will be whatever

870
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
that determinant is,
but it'll be multiplied by

871
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
zero, so I won't bother.

872
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
OK, there is the formula.

873
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And that now tells us -- I
could figure out what A4 is now.

874
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Oh yeah, finally I can get A4.

875
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Because it's A3,
which is minus one,

876
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
minus A2, which is zero,
so it's minus one.

877
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
You see how we're getting kind
of numbers that you might not

878
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
have guessed.

879
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So our sequence right now is
one zero minus one minus one.

880
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,710
What's the next one in the
sequence, A5?

881
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:08,000
A5 is this minus this,
so it is zero.

882
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
What's A6?

883
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
A6 is this minus this,
which is one.

884
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
What's A7?

885
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I'm, I'm going to be stopped by
either the time runs out or the

886
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
board runs out.

887
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
OK, A7 is this minus this,
which is one.

888
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'll stop here,
because time is out,

889
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,610
but let me tell you what we've
got.

890
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:41,000
What -- these determinants have
this series, one zero minus one

891
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
minus one zero one,
and then it starts repeating.

892
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
It's pretty fantastic.

893
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,410
These determinants have period
six.

894
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:54,000
So the determinant of A
sixty-one

895
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
would be the determinant of A1,
which would be one.

896
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,000
OK.
I hope you liked that example.

897
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
A non-trivial example of a
tri-diagonal determinant.

898
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Thanks.
See you on Wednesday.
