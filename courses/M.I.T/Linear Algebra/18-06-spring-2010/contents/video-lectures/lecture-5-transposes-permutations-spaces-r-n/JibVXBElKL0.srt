1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay.
This is lecture five in linear
algebra.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And, it will complete this
chapter of the book.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So the last section of this
chapter is two point seven that

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
talks about permutations,
which finished the previous

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
lecture, and transposes,
which also came in the previous

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
lecture.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
There's a little more to do
with those guys,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
permutations and transposes.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But then the heart of the
lecture will be the beginning of

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
what you could say is the
beginning of linear algebra,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
the beginning of real linear
algebra which is seeing a bigger

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
picture with vector spaces --
not just vectors,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
but spaces of vectors and
sub-spaces of those spaces.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So we're a little ahead of the
syllabus, which is good,

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
because we're coming to the
place where, there's a lot to

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
do.
Okay.

17
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,000
So, to begin with permutations.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Can I just -- so these
permutations,

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
those are matrices P and they
execute row exchanges.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And we may need them.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We may have a perfectly good
matrix, a perfect matrix A

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
that's invertible that we can
solve A x=b, but to do it --

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I've got to allow myself that
extra freedom that if a zero

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
shows up in the pivot position I
move it away.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I get a non-zero.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I get a proper pivot there by
exchanging from a row below.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And you've seen that already,
and I just want to collect the

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
ideas together.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And principle,
I could even have to do that

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
two times, or more times.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So I have to allow -- to
complete the -- the theory,

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
the possibility that I take my
matrix A, I start elimination,

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I find out that I need row
exchanges and I do it and

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
continue and I finish.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Then all I want to do is say --
and I won't make a big project

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
out of this -- what happens to A
equal L U?

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So A equal L U -- this was a
matrix L with ones on the

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,200
diagonal and zeroes above and
multipliers below,

40
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,000
and this U we know,
with zeroes down here.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's only possible.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That description of elimination
assumes that we don't have a P,

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
that we don't have any row
exchanges.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,600
And now I just want to say,
okay, how do I account for row

45
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,000
exchanges?

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Because that doesn't.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The P in this factorization is
the identity matrix.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The rows were in a good order,
we left them there.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Maybe I'll just add a little
moment of reality,

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
too, about how Matlab actually
does elimination.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Matlab not only checks whether
that pivot is not zero,

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
as every human would do.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It checks for is that pivot big
enough, because it doesn't like

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
very, very small pivots.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Pivots close to zero are
numerically bad.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So actually if we ask Matlab to
solve a system,

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
it will do some elimination
some row exchanges,

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
which we don't think are
necessary.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Algebra doesn't say they're
necessary, but accuracy --

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
numerical accuracy says they
are.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Well, we're doing algebra,
so here we will say,

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
well, what do row exchanges do,
but we won't do them unless we

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
have to.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But we may have to.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And then, the result is -- it's
hiding here.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's the main fact.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is the description of
elimination with row exchanges.

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So A equal L U becomes P A
equal L U.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,460
So this P is the matrix that
does the row exchanges,

70
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,000
and actually it does them -- it
gets the rows into the right

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,480
order, into the good order where
pivots will not --

72
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,000
where zeroes won't appear in
the pivot position,

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
where L and U will come out
right as up here.

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So, that's the point.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Actually, I don't want to labor
that point, that a permutation

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
matrix -- and you remember what
those were.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'll remind you from last time
of what the main points about

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
permutation matrices were -- and
then just leave this

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
factorization as the general
case.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This is -- any invertible A we
get this.

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
For almost every one,
we don't need a P.

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But there's that handful that
do need row exchanges,

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and if we do need them,
there they are.

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay, finally,
just to remember what P was.

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So permutations,
P is the identity matrix with

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
reordered rows.

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I include in reordering the
possibility that you just leave

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
them the same.

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So the identity matrix is --
okay.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's, like,
your basic permutation matrix

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
-- your do-nothing permutation
matrix is the identity.

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And then there are the ones
that exchange two rows and then

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
the ones that exchange three
rows and then then ones that

94
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
exchange four -- well,
it gets a little -- it gets

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
more interesting algebraically
if you've got four rows,

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
you might exchange them all in
one big cycle.

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
One to two, two to three,
three to four,

98
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
four to one.

99
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,020
Or you might have -- exchange
one and two and three and four.

100
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,000
Lots of possibilities there.

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
In fact, how many
possibilities?

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,200
The answer was (n)factorial.

103
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,000
This is n(n-1)(n-2)...
(3)(2)(1).

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's the number of -- this
counts the reorderings,

105
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
the possible reorderings.

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So it counts all the n by n
permutations.

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And all those matrices have
these --

108
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
have this nice property that
they're all invertible,

109
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
because we can bring those rows
back into the normal order.

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,860
And the matrix that does that
is just P -- is just the same as

111
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,000
the transpose.

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You might take a permutation
matrix, multiply by its

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
transpose and you will see how
--

114
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
that the ones hit the ones and
give the ones in the identity

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
matrix.

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So this is a -- we'll be highly
interested in matrices that have

117
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
nice properties.

118
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And one property that -- maybe
I could rewrite that as P

119
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
transpose P is the identity.

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That tells me in other words
that this is the inverse of

121
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
that.

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay.
We'll be interested in matrices
that have P transpose P equal

123
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
the identity.

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
There are more of them than
just permutations,

125
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
but my point right now is that
permutations are like a little

126
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
group in the middle -- in the
center of these special

127
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
matrices.

128
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay.

129
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So now we know how many there
are.

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,950
Twenty four in the case of --
there are twenty four four by

131
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,000
four permutations,
there are five factorial which

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
is a hundred and twenty,
five times twenty four would

133
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
bump us up to a hundred and
twenty --

134
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
so listing all the five by five
permutations would be not so

135
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
much fun.

136
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Okay.

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So that's permutations.

138
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,590
Now also in section two seven
is some discussion of

139
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,000
transposes.

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And can I just complete that
discussion.

141
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
First of all,
I haven't even transposed a

142
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
matrix on the board here,
have I?

143
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So I'd better do it.

144
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So suppose I take a matrix like
(1 2 4; 3 3 1).

145
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's a rectangular matrix,
three by two.

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And I want to transpose it.

147
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So what's -- I'll use a T,
also Matlab would use a prime.

148
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And the result will be -- I'll
right it here,

149
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
because this was three rows and
two columns, this was a three by

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
two matrix.

151
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The transpose will be two rows
and three columns,

152
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
two by three.

153
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So it's short and wider.

154
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And, of course,
that row -- that column becomes

155
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,860
a row --
that column becomes the other

156
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,000
row.

157
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And at the same time,
that row became a column.

158
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,560
This row became a column.

159
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, what's the general formula
for the transpose?

160
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So the transpose -- you see it
in numbers.

161
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What I'm going to write is the
same thing in symbols.

162
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The numbers are the clearest,
of course.

163
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But in symbols,
if I take A transpose and I ask

164
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
what number is in row I and
column J of A transpose?

165
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, it came out of A.

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It came out A by this flip
across the main diagonal.

167
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And, actually,
it was the number in A which

168
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
was in row J,
column I.

169
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So the row and column -- the
row and column numbers just get

170
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
reversed.

171
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,890
The row number becomes the
column number,

172
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:43,000
the column number becomes the
row number.

173
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
No problem.

174
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Okay.

175
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Now, a special -- the best
matrices, we could say.

176
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
In a lot of applications,
symmetric matrices show up.

177
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So can I just call attention to
symmetric matrices?

178
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What does that mean?

179
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What does that word symmetric
mean?

180
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It means that this transposing
doesn't change the matrix.

181
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
A transpose equals A.

182
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And an example.

183
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,390
So, let's take a matrix that's
symmetric, so whatever is

184
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:30,000
sitting on the diagonal -- but
now what's above the diagonal,

185
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
like a one, had better be
there, a seven had better be

186
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
here, a nine had better be
there.

187
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
There's a symmetric matrix.

188
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I happened to use all positive
numbers as its entries.

189
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That's not the point.

190
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The point is that if I
transpose that matrix,

191
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I get it back again.

192
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So symmetric matrices have this
property A transpose equals A.

193
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I guess at this point --
I'm just asking you to notice

194
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
this family of matrices that are
unchanged by transposing.

195
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And they're easy to identify,
of course.

196
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You know, it's not maybe so
easy before we had a case where

197
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
the transpose gave the inverse.

198
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's highly important,
but not so simple to see.

199
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This is the case where the
transpose gives the same matrix

200
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,000
back again.
That's totally simple to see.

201
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Okay.
Could actually -- maybe I could
even say when would we get such

202
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
a matrix?

203
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
For example,
this -- that matrix is

204
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
absolutely far from symmetric,
right?

205
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The transpose isn't even the
same shape --

206
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
because it's rectangular,
it turns the -- lies down on

207
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
its side.

208
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But let me tell you a way to
get a symmetric matrix out of

209
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,000
this.
Multiply those together.

210
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
If I multiply this rectangular,
shall I call it R for

211
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
rectangular?

212
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,460
So let that be R for
rectangular matrix and let that

213
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,000
be R transpose,
which it is.

214
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Then I think that if I multiply
those together,

215
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,940
I get a symmetric matrix.

216
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,000
Can I just do it with the
numbers and then ask you why,

217
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,710
how did I know it would be
symmetric?

218
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:48,000
So my point is that R transpose
R is always symmetric.

219
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Okay?

220
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And I'm going to do it for that
particular R transpose R which

221
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
was -- let's see,
the column was one two four

222
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
three three one.

223
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I called that one R transpose,
didn't I, and I called this guy

224
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
one two four three three one.

225
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I called that R.

226
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Shall we just do that
multiplication?

227
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay, so up here I'm getting a
ten.

228
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Next to it I'm getting two,
a nine, I'm getting an eleven.

229
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Next to that I'm getting four
and three, a seven.

230
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Now what do I get there?

231
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
This eleven came from one three
times two three,

232
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,510
right?

233
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,000
Row one, column two.

234
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What goes here?

235
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Row two, column one.

236
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But no difference.

237
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
One three two three or two
three one three,

238
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
same thing.

239
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,330
It's going to be an eleven.

240
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,000
That's the symmetry.

241
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I can continue to fill it out.

242
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What -- oh, let's get that
seven.

243
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That seven will show up down
here, too, and then four more

244
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
numbers.

245
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
That seven will show up here
because one three times four one

246
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
gave the seven,
but also four one times one

247
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,960
three will give that seven.

248
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,000
Do you see that it works?

249
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Actually, do you want to see it
work also in matrix language?

250
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I mean, that's quite
convincing, right?

251
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That seven is no accident.

252
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The eleven is no accident.

253
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But just tell me how do I know
if I transpose this guy --

254
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
How do I know it's symmetric?

255
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Well, I'm going to transpose
it.

256
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And when I transpose it,
I'm hoping I get the matrix

257
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
back again.

258
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So can I transpose R transpose
R?

259
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So just -- so,
why?

260
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Well, my suggestion is take the
transpose.

261
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That's the only way to show
it's symmetric.

262
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Take the transpose and see that
it didn't change.

263
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Okay, so I take the transpose
of R transpose R.

264
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay.

265
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
How do I do that?

266
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
This is our little practice on
the rules for transposes.

267
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So the rule for transposes is
the order gets reversed.

268
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Just like inverses,
which we did prove,

269
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
same rule for transposes and --
which we'll now use.

270
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So the order gets reversed.

271
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's the transpose of that that
comes first, and the transpose

272
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
of this that comes -- no.

273
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Is that -- yeah.

274
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That's what I have to write,
right?

275
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
This is a product of two
matrices and I want its

276
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,000
transpose.
So I put the matrices in the
opposite order and I transpose

277
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,770
them.

278
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,000
But what have I got here?

279
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What is R transpose transpose?

280
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Well, don't all speak at once.

281
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
R transpose transpose,
I flipped over the diagonal,

282
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I flipped over the diagonal
again, so I've got R.

283
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And that's just my point,
that if I started with this

284
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,460
matrix, I transposed it,
I got it back again.

285
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,000
So that's the check,
without using numbers,

286
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
but with --
it checked in two lines that I

287
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
always get symmetric matrices
this way.

288
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And actually,
that's where they come from in

289
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,910
so many practical applications.

290
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,000
Okay.

291
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So now I've said something
today about permutations and

292
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
about transposes and about
symmetry and I'm ready for

293
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
chapter three.

294
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Can we take a breath -- the
tape won't take a breath,

295
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,000
but the lecturer will,
because to tell you about

296
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:41,000
vector spaces is -- we really
have to start now and think,

297
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
okay, listen up.

298
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What are vector spaces?

299
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And what are sub-spaces?

300
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Okay.

301
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So, the point is,
The main operations that we do

302
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
-- what do we do with vectors?

303
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
We add them.

304
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
We know how to add two vectors.

305
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
We multiply them by numbers,
usually called scalers.

306
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
If we have a vector,
we know what three V is.

307
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If we have a vector V and W,
we know what V plus W is.

308
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Those are the two operations
that we've got to be able to do.

309
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
To legitimately talk about a
space of vectors,

310
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
the requirement is that we
should be able to add the things

311
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,570
and multiply by numbers and that
there should be some decent

312
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,710
rules satisfied.

313
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,000
Okay.

314
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,680
So let me start with examples.

315
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,990
So I'm talking now about vector
spaces.

316
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,000
And I'm going to start with
examples.

317
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Let me say again what this word
space is meaning.

318
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
When I say that word space,
that means to me that I've got

319
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
a bunch of vectors,
a space of vectors.

320
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,080
But not just any bunch of
vectors.

321
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:23,000
It has to be a space of vectors
-- has to allow me to do the

322
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
operations that vectors are for.

323
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I have to be able to add
vectors and multiply by numbers.

324
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I have to be able to take
linear combinations.

325
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Well, where did we meet linear
combinations?

326
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
We met them back in,
say in R^2.

327
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,150
So there's a vector space.

328
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,000
What's that vector space?

329
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So R two is telling me I'm
talking about real numbers and

330
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm talking about two real
numbers.

331
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So this is all two dimensional
vectors -- real,

332
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
such as -- well,
I'm not going to be able to

333
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
list them all.

334
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But let me put a few down.
|3; 2|, |0;0|,

335
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
|pi; e|.

336
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,450
So on.

337
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,000
And it's natural -- okay.

338
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,230
Let's see, I guess I should do
algebra first.

339
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:45,000
Algebra means what can I do to
these vectors?

340
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I can add them.

341
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I can add that to that.

342
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And how do I do it?

343
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
A component at a time,
of course.

344
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Three two added to zero zero
gives me, three two.

345
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Sorry about that.

346
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Three two added to pi e gives
me three plus pi,

347
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
two plus e.

348
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh, you know what it does.

349
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And you know the picture that
goes with it.

350
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
There's the vector three two.

351
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And often, the picture has an
arrow.

352
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
The vector zero zero,
which is a highly important

353
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
vector -- it's got,
like, the most important here

354
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,000
-- is there.
And of course there's not much
of an arrow.

355
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:34,000
Pi -- I'll have to remember --
pi is about three and a little

356
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
more, e is about two and a
little more.

357
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So maybe there's pi e.

358
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I never drew pi e before.

359
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's just natural to -- this is
the first component on the

360
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
horizontal and this is the
second component,

361
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
going up the vertical.

362
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Okay.

363
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And the whole plane is R two.

364
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So R two is,
we could say,

365
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
the plane.

366
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The xy plane.

367
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
That's what everybody thinks.

368
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But the point is it's a vector
space because all those vectors

369
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
are in there.

370
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:38,000
If I removed one of them --
Suppose I removed zero zero.

371
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Suppose I tried to take the --
considered the X Y plane with a

372
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
puncture, with a point removed.

373
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Like the origin.

374
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That would be,
like, awful to take the origin

375
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
away.

376
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Why is that?

377
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Why do I need the origin there?

378
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Because I have to be allowed --
if I had these other vectors,

379
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I have to be allowed to
multiply three two -- this was

380
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
three two -- by anything,
by any scaler,

381
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
including zero.

382
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I've got to be allowed to
multiply by zero and the

383
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
result's got to be there.

384
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I can't do without that point.

385
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And I have to be able to add
three two to the opposite guy,

386
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
minus three minus two.

387
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And if I add those I'm back to
the origin again.

388
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
No way I can do without the
origin.

389
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Every vector space has got that
zero vector in it.

390
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:43,040
Okay, that's an easy vector
space, because we have a natural

391
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,000
picture of it.

392
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Okay.

393
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Similarly easy is R^3.

394
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,000
This would be all -- let me go
up a little here.

395
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
This would be -- R three would
be all three dimensional vectors

396
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
--
or shall I say vectors with

397
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
three real components.

398
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Okay.

399
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Let me just to be sure we're
together, let me take the vector

400
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
three two zero.

401
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Is that a vector in R^2 or R^3?

402
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Definitely it's in R^3.

403
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It's got three components.

404
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
One of them happens to be zero,
but that's a perfectly okay

405
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,000
number.
So that's a vector in R^3.

406
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
We don't want to mix up the --
I mean, keep these vectors

407
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,930
straight and keep R^n straight.

408
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,000
So what's R^n?

409
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,000
R^n.
So this is our big example,
is all vectors with n

410
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
components.

411
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And I'm making these darn
things column vectors.

412
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Can I try to follow that
convention, that they'll be

413
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
column vectors,
and their components should be

414
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
real numbers.

415
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,050
Later we'll need complex
numbers and complex vectors,

416
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,000
but much later.

417
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Okay.
So that's a vector space.

418
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,350
Now, let's see.

419
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,000
What do I have to tell you
about vector spaces?

420
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I said the most important
thing, which is that we can add

421
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
any two of these and we -- still
in R^2.

422
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
We can multiply by any number
and we're still in R^2.

423
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
We can take any combination and
we're still in R^2.

424
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And same goes for R^n.

425
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's -- honesty requires me to
mention that these operations of

426
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,210
adding and multiplying have to
obey a few rules.

427
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:11,000
Like, we can't just arbitrarily
say, okay, the sum of three two

428
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and pi e is zero zero.

429
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's not.

430
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
The sum of three two and minus
three two is zero zero.

431
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So -- oh, I'm not going to --
the book, actually,

432
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
lists the eight rules that the
addition and multiplication have

433
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
to satisfy, but they do.

434
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
They certainly satisfy it in
R^n and usually it's not those

435
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
eight rules that are in doubt.

436
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
What's -- the question is,
can we do those additions and

437
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
do we stay in the space?

438
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Let me show you a case where
you can't.

439
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So suppose this is going to be
not a vector space.

440
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Suppose I take the xy plane --
so there's R^2.

441
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
That is a vector space.

442
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Now suppose I just take part of
it.

443
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Just this.

444
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Just this one -- this is one
quarter of the vector space.

445
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,990
All the vectors with positive
or at least not negative

446
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,000
components.

447
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Can I add those safely?

448
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yes.
If I add a vector with,
like, two -- three two to

449
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
another vector like five six,
I'm still up in this quarter,

450
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
no problem with adding.

451
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
But there's a heck of a problem
with multiplying by scalers,

452
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
because there's a lot of
scalers that will take me out of

453
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
this quarter plane,
like negative ones.

454
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
If I took three two and I
multiplied by minus five,

455
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm way down here.

456
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So that's not a vector space,
because it's not -- closed is

457
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,420
the right word.

458
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,000
It's not closed under
multiplication by all real

459
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
numbers.

460
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So a vector space has to be
closed under multiplication and

461
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
addition of vectors.

462
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
In other words,
linear combinations.

463
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It -- so, it means that if I
give you a few vectors -- yeah

464
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
look, here's an important --
here -- now we're getting to

465
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
some really important vector
spaces.

466
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Well, R^n -- like,
they are the most important.

467
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,000
But we will be interested in
so- in vector spaces that are

468
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
inside R^n.

469
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Vector spaces that follow the
rules, but they -- we don't need

470
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
all of -- see,
there we started with R^2 here,

471
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
and took part of it and messed
it up.

472
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
What we got was not a vector
space.

473
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Now tell me a vector space that
is part of R^2 and is still

474
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
safely --
we can multiply,

475
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
we can add and we stay in this
smaller vector space.

476
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So it's going to be called a
subspace.

477
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So I'm going to change this bad
example to a good one.

478
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay.

479
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So I'm going to start again
with R^2, but I'm going to take

480
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
an example --
it is a vector space,

481
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,900
so it'll be a vector space
inside R^2.

482
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:01,000
And we'll call that a subspace
of R^2.

483
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,250
Okay.

484
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,000
What can I do?

485
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It's got something in it.

486
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Suppose it's got this vector in
it.

487
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Okay.

488
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
If that vector's in my little
subspace and it's a true

489
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
subspace, then there's got to be
some more in it,

490
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,000
right?
I have to be able to multiply
that by two, and that double

491
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
vector has to be included.

492
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Have to be able to multiply by
zero, that vector,

493
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
or by half, or by three
quarters.

494
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
All these vectors.

495
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Or by minus a half,
or by minus one.

496
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I have to be able to multiply
by any number.

497
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So that is going to say that I
have to have that whole line.

498
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Do you see that?

499
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Once I get a vector in there --
I've got the whole line of all

500
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
multiples of that vector.

501
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,070
I can't have a vector space
without extending to get those

502
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,000
multiples in there.

503
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Now I still have to check
addition.

504
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But that comes out okay.

505
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,670
This line is going to work,
because I could add something

506
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:29,000
on the line to something else on
the line and I'm still on the

507
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
line.

508
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,510
So, example.

509
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:37,000
So this is all examples of a
subspace -- our example is a

510
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,260
line in R^2 actually -- not just
any line.

511
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,000
If I took this line,
would that -- so all the

512
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
vectors on that line.

513
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So that vector and that vector
and this vector and this vector

514
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
-- in lighter type,
I'm drawing something that

515
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
doesn't work.

516
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It's not a subspace.

517
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,000
The line in R^2 -- to be a
subspace, the line in R^2 must

518
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
go through the zero vector.

519
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Because -- why is this line no
good?

520
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Let me do a dashed line.

521
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Because if I multiplied that
vector on the dashed line by

522
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
zero, then I'm down here,
I'm not on the dashed line.

523
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Z- zero's got to be.

524
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Every subspace has got to
contain zero --

525
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
because I must be allowed to
multiply by zero and that will

526
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
always give me the zero vector.

527
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Okay.

528
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Now, I was going to make --
create some subspaces.

529
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Oh, while I'm in R^2,
why don't we think of all the

530
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
possibilities.

531
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
R two, there can't be that
many.

532
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So what are the possible
subspaces of R^2?

533
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Let me list them.

534
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So I'm listing now the
subspaces of R^2.

535
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And one possibility that we
always allow is all of R two,

536
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
the whole thing,
the whole space.

537
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That counts as a subspace of
itself.

538
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You always want to allow that.

539
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:43,240
Then the others are lines --
any line, meaning infinitely far

540
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,000
in both directions through the
zero.

541
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So that's like the whole space
-- that's like whole two D

542
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
space.

543
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
This is like one dimension.

544
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Is this line the same as R^1 ?

545
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,740
No.

546
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,790
You could say it looks a lot
like R^1.

547
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,000
R^1 was just a line and this is
a line.

548
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But this is a line inside R^2.

549
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
The vectors here have two
components.

550
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So that's not the same as R^1,
because there the vectors only

551
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
have one component.

552
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Very close, you could say,
but not the same.

553
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Okay.

554
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And now there's a third
possibility.

555
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,000
There's a third subspace that's
-- of R^2 that's not the whole

556
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
thing, and it's not a line.

557
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It's even less.

558
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's just the zero vector
alone.

559
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
The zero vector alone,
only.

560
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'll often call this subspace
Z, just for zero.

561
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Here's a line,
L.

562
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Here's a plane,
all of R^2.

563
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So, do you see that the zero
vector's okay?

564
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You would just -- to understand
subspaces, we have to know the

565
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
rules --
and knowing the rules means

566
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
that we have to see that yes,
the zero vector by itself,

567
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
just this guy alone satisfies
the rules.

568
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Why's that?

569
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Oh, it's too dumb to tell you.

570
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
If I took that and added it to
itself, I'm still there.

571
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
If I took that and multiplied
by seventeen,

572
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I'm still there.

573
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
So I've done the operations,
adding and multiplying by

574
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
numbers, that are required,
and I didn't go outside this

575
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
one point space.

576
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,600
So that's always -- that's the
littlest subspace.

577
00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:00,000
And the largest subspace is the
whole thing and in-between come

578
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
all -- whatever's in between.

579
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Okay.
So for example,
what's in between for R^3?

580
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So if I'm in ordinary three
dimensions, the subspace is R,

581
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
all of R^3 at one extreme,
the zero vector at the bottom.

582
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And then a plane,
a plane through the origin.

583
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Or a line, a line through the
origin.

584
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So with R^3,
the subspaces were R^3,

585
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,000
plane through the origin,
line through the origin and a

586
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
zero vector by itself,
zero zero zero,

587
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
just that single vector.

588
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Okay, you've got the idea.

589
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:54,000
But, now comes -- the reality
is -- what are these -- where do

590
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:02,000
these subspaces come -- how do
they come out of matrices?

591
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And I want to take this matrix
-- oh, let me take that matrix.

592
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So I want to create some
subspaces out of that matrix.

593
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Well, one subspace is from the
columns.

594
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Okay.

595
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So this is the important
subspace, the first important

596
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,000
subspace that comes from that
matrix -- I'm going to -- let me

597
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
call it A again.

598
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Back to -- okay.

599
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I'm looking at the columns of
A.

600
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Those are vectors in R^3.

601
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So the columns are in R^3.

602
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
The columns are in R^3.

603
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
So I want those columns to be
in my subspace.

604
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Now I can't just put two
columns in my subspace and call

605
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
it a subspace.

606
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
What do I have to throw in --
if I'm going to put those two

607
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
columns in, what else has got to
be there to have a subspace?

608
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I must be able to add those
things.

609
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So the sum of those columns --
so these columns are in R^3,

610
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and I have to be able -- I'm,
you know, I want that to be in

611
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
my subspace, I want that to be
in my subspace,

612
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
but therefore I have to be able
to multiply them by anything.

613
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Zero zero zero has got to be in
my subspace.

614
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I have to be able to add them
so that four five five is in the

615
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
subspace.

616
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,330
I've got to be able to add one
of these plus three of these.

617
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:00,000
That'll give me some other
vector.

618
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I have to be able to take all
the linear combinations.

619
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
So these are columns in R^3 and
all there linear combinations

620
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,590
form a subspace.

621
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:17,000
What do I mean by linear
combinations?

622
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,970
I mean multiply that by
something, multiply that by

623
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,000
something and add.

624
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
The two operations of linear
algebra, multiplying by numbers

625
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
and adding vectors.

626
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And, if I include all the
results, then I'm guaranteed to

627
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
have a subspace.

628
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I've done the job.

629
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And we'll give it a name -- the
column space.

630
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Column space.

631
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And maybe I'll call it C of A.

632
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
C for column space.

633
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:16,000
There's an idea there that --
Like, the central idea for

634
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
today's lecture is -- got a few
vectors.

635
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Not satisfied with a few
vectors, we want a space of

636
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,670
vectors.

637
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,000
The vectors,
they're in -- these vectors in

638
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
-- are in R^3 ,
so our space of vectors will be

639
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
vectors in R^3.

640
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
The key idea's --
we have to be able to take

641
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
their combinations.

642
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So tell me, geometrically,
if I drew all these things --

643
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
like if I drew one two four,
that would be somewhere maybe

644
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,000
there.
If I drew three three one,
who knows, might be -- I don't

645
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
know, I'll say there.

646
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
There's column one,
there's column two.

647
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
What else -- what's in the
whole column space?

648
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
How do I draw the whole column
space now?

649
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I take all combinations of
those two vectors.

650
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Do I get -- well,
I guess I actually listed the

651
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
possibilities.

652
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Do I get the whole space?

653
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Do I get a plane?

654
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I get more than a line,
that's for sure.

655
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,240
And I certainly get more than
the zero vector,

656
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,000
but I do get the zero vector
included.

657
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
What do I get if I combine --
take all the combinations of

658
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
two vectors in R^3 ?

659
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So I've got all this stuff on
-- that whole line gets filled

660
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
out, that whole line gets filled
out, but all in-between gets

661
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
filled out -- between the two
lines because I --

662
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I allowed to add something from
one line, something from the

663
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
other.

664
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
You see what's coming?

665
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I'm getting a plane.

666
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,900
That's my -- and it's through
the origin.

667
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,000
Those two vectors,
namely one two four and three

668
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
three one, when I take all their
combinations,

669
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,900
I fill out a whole plane.

670
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,000
Please think about that.

671
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
That's the picture you have to
see.

672
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
You sure have to see it in R^3
, because we're going to do it

673
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
in R^10, and we may take a
combination of five vectors in

674
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
R^10, and what will we have?

675
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,050
God knows.

676
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:41,000
It's some subspace.

677
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,720
We'll have five vectors.

678
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,000
They'll all have ten
components.

679
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,670
We take their combinations.

680
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:52,000
We don't have R^5 ,
because our vectors have ten

681
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
components.

682
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And we possibly have,
like, some five dimensional

683
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
flat thing going through the
origin for sure.

684
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Well, of course,
if those five vectors were all

685
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
on the line, then we would only
get that line.

686
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
So, you see,
there are, like,

687
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
other possibilities here.

688
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,800
It depends what --
it depends on those five

689
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,610
vectors.

690
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:27,000
Just like if our two columns
had been on the same line,

691
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,040
then the column space would
have been only a line.

692
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,000
Here it was a plane.

693
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Okay.
I'm going to stop at that
point.

694
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:43,000
That's the central idea of --
the great example of how to

695
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
create a subspace from a matrix.

696
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Take its columns,
take their combinations,

697
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
all their linear combinations
and you get the column space.

698
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And that's the central sort of
-- we're looking at linear

699
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
algebra at a higher level.

700
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
When I look at A -- now,
I want to look at Ax=b.

701
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
That'll be the first thing in
the next lecture.

702
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
How do I understand Ax=b in
this language -- in this new

703
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
language of vector spaces and
column spaces.

704
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And what are other subspaces?

705
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
So the column space is a big
one, there are others to come.

706
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Okay, thanks.
