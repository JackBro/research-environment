1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
OK.
Here's lecture sixteen and if
you remember I ended up the last

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,500
lecture with this formula for
what I called a projection

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,000
matrix.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And maybe I could just recap
for a minute what is that magic

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
formula doing?

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
For example,
it's supposed to be --

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
it's supposed to produce a
projection, if I multiply by a

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
b, so I take P times b,
I'm supposed to project that

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
vector b to the nearest point in
the column space.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
OK.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,700
Can I just -- one way to recap
is to take the two extreme

12
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,000
cases.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Suppose a vector b is in the
column space?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Then what do I get when I apply
the projection P?

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,760
So I'm projecting into the
column space but I'm starting

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,000
with a vector in this case
that's already in the column

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
space, so of course when I
project it I get B again,

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
right.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And I want to show you how that
comes out of this formula.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let me do the other extreme.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Suppose that vector is
perpendicular to the column

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
space.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So imagine this column space as
a plane and imagine b as

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
sticking straight up
perpendicular to it.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What's the nearest point in the
column space to b in that case?

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So what's the projection onto
the plane, the nearest point in

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,280
the plane, if the vector b that
I'm looking at is --

28
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,000
got no component in the column
space, it's sticking completely

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
-- ninety degrees with it,
then Pb should be zero,

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
right.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So those are the two extreme
cases.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,960
The average vector has a
component P in the column space

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,000
and a component perpendicular to
it, and what the projection does

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
is it kills this part and it
preserves this part.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,000
OK.
Can we just see why that's
true?

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Just -- that formula ought to
work.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So let me start with this one.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What vectors are in the -- are
perpendicular to the column

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
space?
How do I see that I really get
zero?

40
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,000
I have to think,
what does it mean for a vector

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
b to be perpendicular to the
column space?

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,980
So if it's perpendicular to all
the columns, then it's in some

43
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,000
other space.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We've got our four spaces so
the reason I do this is it's

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
perfectly using what we know
about our four spaces.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What vectors are perpendicular
to the column space?

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Those are the guys in the null
space of A transpose,

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
right?
That's the first section of
this chapter,

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
that's the key geometry of
these spaces.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If I'm perpendicular to the
column space,

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm in the null space of A
transpose.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
OK.
So if I'm in the null space of
A transpose, and I multiply this

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
big formula times b,
so now I'm getting Pb,

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
this is now the projection,
Pb, do you see that I get zero?

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Of course I get zero.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Right at the end there,
A transpose b will give me zero

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
right away.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So that's why that zero's here.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Because if I'm perpendicular to
the column space,

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,460
then I'm in the null space of A
transpose and A transpose b is

61
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:05,000
zilch.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
OK, what about the other
possibility.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
How do I see that this formula
gives me the right answer if b

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
is in the column space?

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So what's a typical vector in
the column space?

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's a combination of the
columns.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
How do I write a combination of
the columns?

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So tell me, how would I write,
you know, your everyday vector

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
that's in the column space?

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It would have the form A times
some x, right?

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's what's in the column
space, A times something.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,340
That makes it a combination of
the columns.

73
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,000
So these b's were in the null
space of A transpose.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
These guys in the column space,
those b's are Ax-s.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Right?

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,090
If b is in the column space
then it has the form Ax.

77
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm going to stick that on the
quiz or the final for sure.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That you have to realize --
because we've said it like a

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
thousand times that the things
in the column space are vectors

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
A times x.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
OK.
And do you see what happens now
if we use our formula?

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
There's an A transpose A.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Gets canceled by its inverse.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We're left with an A times x.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So the result was Ax.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Which was b.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Do you see that it works?

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is that whole business.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Cancel, cancel,
leaving Ax.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And Ax was b.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So that turned out to be b,
in this case.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
OK, so geometrically what we're
seeing is we're taking a vector

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,710
--
we've got the column space and

94
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:01,000
perpendicular to that is the
null space of A transpose.

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,220
And our typical vector b is out
here.

96
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,000
There's zero,
so there's our typical vector

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
b, and what we're doing is we're
projecting it to P.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And the --
and of course at the same time

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
we're finding the other part of
it which is e.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So the two pieces,
the projection piece and the

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
error piece, add up to the
original b.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
OK.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's like what our matrix
does.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So this is P -- P is --
this P is Ab,

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
is sorry -- is Pb,
it's the projection,

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
applied to b,
and this one is -- OK,

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
that's a projection too.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's a projection down onto
that space.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What's a good formula for it?

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Suppose I ask you for the
projection of the projection

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
matrix onto the --
this space, this perpendicular

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
space?

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So if this projection was P,
what's the projection that

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
gives me e?

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's the -- what I want is to
get the rest of the vector,

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
so it'll be just I minus P
times b, that's a projection

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
too.

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's the projection onto the
perpendicular space.

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
OK.

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So if P's a projection,
I minus P is a projection.

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
If P is symmetric,
I minus P is symmetric.

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,960
If P squared equals P,
then I minus P squared equals I

123
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,000
minus P.

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's just -- the algebra -- is
only doing what your --

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
picture is completely telling
you.

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But the algebra leads to this
expression.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That expression for P given --
given a basis for the subspace,

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
given the matrix A whose
columns are a basis for our

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
column space.

130
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,000
OK, that's recap because you --
you need to see that formula

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
more than once.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And now can I pick up on using
it?

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So now -- and the -- it's like,
let me do that again,

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll go right through a problem
that I started at the end,

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
which is find a best straight
line.

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You remember that problem,
I --

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I picked a particular set of
points, they weren't specially

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
brilliant, t equal one,
two, three, the heights were

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
one, two, and then two again.

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So they were -- heights were
that point, that point,

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
which makes it look like I've
got a nice forty-five-degree

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
line --
but then the third point didn't

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
lie on the line.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,820
And I wanted to find the best
straight line.

145
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,000
So I'm looking for the -- this
line, y=C+Dt.

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And it's not going to go
through all three points,

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
because no line goes through
all three points.

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So I'm going to pick the best
line, the --

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
the best being the one that
makes the overall error as small

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
as I can make it.

151
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,470
Now I have to tell you,
what is that overall error?

152
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,000
And -- because that determines
what's the winning line.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If we don't know -- I mean we
have to decide what we mean by

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
the error --
and then we minimize and we

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,200
find the right -- the best C and
D.

156
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,000
OK.

157
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So if I went through this -- if
I went through that point,

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I would solve the equation
C+D=1.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Because at t equal to one --
I'd have C plus D,

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and it would come out right.

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If it went through this point,
I'd have C plus two D equal to

162
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
two.
Because at t equal to two,
I would like to get the answer

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
two.
At the third point,
I have C plus three D because t

164
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:48,000
is three, but the --
the answer I'm shooting for is

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,000
two again.
So those are my three
equations.

166
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And they don't have a solution.

167
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But they've got a best
solution.

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What do I mean by best
solution?

169
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So let me take time out to
remember what I'm talking about

170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,790
for best solution.

171
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,000
So this is my equation Ax=b.

172
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,360
A is this matrix,
one, one, one,

173
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,390
one, two, three.
x is my -- only have two

174
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:25,000
unknowns, C and D,
and b is my right-hand side,

175
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
one, two, three.

176
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,000
OK.
No solution.

177
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,610
Three eq- I have a three by two
matrix, I do have two

178
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:42,000
independent columns --
so I do have a basis for the

179
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
column space,
those two columns are

180
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
independent, they're a basis for
the column space,

181
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
but the column space doesn't
include that vector.

182
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So best possible in this --
what would best possible mean?

183
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The way that comes out to
linear equations is I --

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I want to minimize the sum of
these -- I'm going to make an

185
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
error here.

186
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm going to make an error
here.

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm going to make an error
there.

188
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,020
And I'm going to sum and square
and add up those errors.

189
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,000
So it's a sum of squares.

190
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,130
It's a least squares solution
I'm looking for.

191
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:37,000
So if I --
those errors are the difference

192
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
between Ax and b.

193
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's what I want to make
small.

194
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And the way I'm measuring this
-- this is a vector,

195
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
right?
This is e1,e2 ,e3.

196
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The Ax-b, this is the e.

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The error vector.

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,860
And small means its length.

199
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,000
The length of that vector.

200
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's what I'm going to try to
minimize.

201
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And it's convenient to square.

202
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If I make something small,
I make -- this is a never

203
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
negative quantity,
right?

204
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The length of that vector.

205
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The length will be zero exactly
when the --

206
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
when I have the zero vector
here.

207
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That's exactly the case when I
can solve exactly,

208
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
b is in the column space,
all great.

209
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But I'm not in that case now.

210
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm going to have an error
vector, e.

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What's this error vector in my
picture?

212
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I guess what I'm trying to say
is there's --

213
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
there's two pictures of what's
going on.

214
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
There's two pictures of what's
going on.

215
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
One picture is -- in this is
the three points and the line.

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And in that picture,
what are the three errors?

217
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The three errors are what I
miss by in this equation.

218
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So it's this -- this little bit
here.

219
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That vertical distance up to
the line.

220
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
There's one -- sorry there's
one, and there's C plus D.

221
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And it's that difference.

222
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Here's two and here's C+2D.

223
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So vertically it's that
distance -- that little error

224
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
there is e1.

225
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This little error here is e2.

226
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This little error coming up is
e3.

227
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,240
e3.

228
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,000
And what's my overall error?

229
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Is e1 square plus e2 squared
plus e3 squared.

230
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That's what I'm trying to make
small.

231
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I -- some statisticians -- this
is a big part of statistics,

232
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
fitting straight lines is a big
part of science --

233
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and specifically statistics,
where the right word to use

234
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
would be regression.

235
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,220
I'm doing regression here.

236
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,000
Linear regression.

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And I'm using this sum of
squares as the measure of error.

238
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Again, some statisticians would
be --

239
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,420
they would say,
OK, I'll solve that problem

240
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,000
because it's the clean problem.

241
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It leads to a beautiful linear
system.

242
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But they would be a little
careful about these squares,

243
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
for -- in this case.

244
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
If one of these points was way
off.

245
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Suppose I had a measurement at
t equal zero that was way off.

246
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well, would the straight line,
would the best line be the same

247
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
if I had this fourth point?

248
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Suppose I have this fourth data
point.

249
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
No, certainly the line would --
it wouldn't be the -- that

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
wouldn't be the best line.

251
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,960
Because that line would have a
giant error --

252
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,000
and when I squared it it would
be like way out of sight

253
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
compared to the others.

254
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,740
So this would be called by
statisticians an outlier,

255
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,000
and they would not be happy to
see the whole problem turned

256
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
topsy-turvy by this one outlier,
which could be a mistake,

257
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
after all.

258
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So they wouldn't -- so they
wouldn't like maybe squaring,

259
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
if there were outliers,
they would want to identify

260
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
them.

261
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,000
OK.
I'm not going to -- I don't
want to suggest that least

262
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
squares isn't used,
it's the most used,

263
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
but it's not exclusively used
because it's a little --

264
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
overcompensates for outliers.

265
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Because of that squaring.

266
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,000
OK.
So suppose we don't have this
guy, we just have these three

267
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
equations.

268
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And I want to make -- minimize
this error.

269
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,000
OK.
Now, what I said is there's two
pictures to look at.

270
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
One picture is this one.

271
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The three points,
the best line.

272
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And the errors.

273
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Now, on this picture,
what are these points on the

274
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
line, the points that are really
on the line?

275
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So they're -- points,
let me call them P1,

276
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
P2, and P3, those are three
numbers, so this --

277
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
this height is P1,
this height is P2,

278
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
this height is P3,
and what are those guys?

279
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Suppose those were the three
values instead of -- there's b1,

280
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
ev- everybody's seen all these
-- sorry, my art is as usual not

281
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
the greatest,
but there's the given b1,

282
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
the given b2,
and the given b3.

283
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I promise not to put a single
letter more on that picture.

284
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,000
OK.
There's b1, P1 is the one on
the line, and e1 is the distance

285
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,000
between.
And same at points two and same
at points three.

286
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
OK, so what's up?

287
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What's up with those Ps?

288
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
P1, P2, P3, what are they?

289
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They're the components,
they lie on the line,

290
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,000
right?
They're the points which if
instead of one,

291
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,000
two, two, which were the b's,
suppose I put P1,

292
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
P2, P3 in here.

293
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'll figure out in a minute
what those numbers are.

294
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But I just want to get the
picture of what I'm doing.

295
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
If I put P1,
P2, P3 in those three

296
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
equations, what would be good
about the three equations?

297
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I could solve them.

298
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
A line goes through the Ps.

299
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So the P1, P2,
P3 vector, that's in the column

300
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,000
space.
That is a combination of these
columns.

301
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,000
It's the closest combination.

302
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's this picture.

303
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
See, I've got the two pictures
like here's the picture that

304
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,150
shows the points,
this is a picture in a

305
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:30,000
blackboard plane,
here's a picture that's showing

306
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
the vectors.

307
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,220
The vector b,
which is in this case,

308
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:41,230
in this example is the vector
one, two, two.

309
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:47,000
The column space is in this
case spanned by the -- well,

310
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
you see A there.

311
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The column space of the matrix
one, one, one,

312
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
one, two, three.

313
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And this picture shows the
nearest point.

314
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
There's the -- that point P1,
P2, P3, which I'm going to

315
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
compute before the end of this
hour, is the closest point in

316
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
the column space.

317
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,000
OK.
Let me -- t
I don't dare leave it any

318
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
longer -- can I just compute it
now.

319
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So I want to compute -- find P.

320
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
All right.

321
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Find P.

322
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Find x, which is CD,
find P and P.

323
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
OK.

324
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And I really should put these
little hats on to remind myself

325
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:50,000
that they're the estimated the
best line, not the perfect line.

326
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,000
OK.
OK.

327
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
How do I proceed?

328
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,410
Let's just run through the
mechanics.

329
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,000
What's the equation for x?

330
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The -- or x hat.

331
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The equation for that is A
transpose A x hat equals A

332
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
transpose x -- A transpose b.

333
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The most -- I'm -- will venture
to call that the most important

334
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
equation in statistics.

335
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And in estimation.

336
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And whatever you're -- wherever
you've got error and noise this

337
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
is the estimate that you use
first.

338
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,000
OK.
Whenever you're fitting things
by a few parameters,

339
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
that's the equation to use.

340
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,930
OK, let's solve it.

341
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:47,000
What is A transpose A?

342
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So I have to figure out what
these matrices are.

343
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
One, one, one,
one, two, three and one,

344
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
one, one, one,
two, three, that gives me some

345
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
matrix, that gives me a matrix,
what do I get out of that,

346
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
three, six, six,
and one and four and nine,

347
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
fourteen.

348
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
OK.

349
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And what do I expect to see in
that matrix and I do see it,

350
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
just before I keep going with
the calculation?

351
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I expect that matrix to be
symmetric.

352
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,590
I expect it to be invertible.

353
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:40,000
And near the end of the course
I'm going to say I expect it to

354
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
be positive definite,
but that's a future fact about

355
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
this crucial matrix,
A transpose A.

356
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,430
OK.

357
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,000
And now let me figure A
transpose b.

358
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So let me -- can I tack on b as
an extra column here,

359
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
one, two, two?

360
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And tack on the extra A
transpose b is -- looks like

361
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,180
five and one and four and six,
eleven.

362
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:15,000
I think my equations are three
C plus six D equals five,

363
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
and six D plus fourt-six C plus
fourteen D is eleven.

364
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Can I just for safety see if I
did that right?

365
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
One, one, one times one,
two, two is five.

366
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
One, two, three,
that's one, four and six,

367
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
eleven.

368
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Looks good.

369
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
These are my equations.

370
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:53,000
That's my -- they're called the
normal equations.

371
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'll just write that word down
because it -- so I solve them.

372
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I solve that for C and D.

373
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,480
I would like to -- before I
solve them could I do one thing

374
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,000
that's on the -- that's just
above here?

375
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I would like to -- I'd like to
find these equations from

376
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
calculus.

377
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'd like to find them from this
minimizing thing.

378
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So what's the first error?

379
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
The first error is what I
missed by in the first equation.

380
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
C plus D minus one squared.

381
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,270
And the second error is what I
miss in the second equation.

382
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,000
C plus two D minus two squared.

383
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And the third error squared is
C plus three D minus two

384
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
squared.

385
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
That's my -- overall squared
error that I'm trying to

386
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
minimize.

387
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,000
OK.
So how would you minimize that?

388
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,000
OK, linear algebra has given us
the equations for the minimum.

389
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
But we could use calculus too.

390
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That's a function of two
variables, C and D,

391
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
and we're looking for the
minimum.

392
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,480
So how do we find it?

393
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:33,000
Directly from calculus,
we take partial derivatives,

394
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
right, we've got two variables,
C and D, so take the partial

395
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
derivative with respect to C and
set it to zero,

396
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
and you'll get that equation.

397
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Take the partial derivative
with respect -- I'm not going to

398
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
write it all out,
just -- you will.

399
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,330
The partial derivative with
respect to D,

400
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,000
it -- you know,
it's going to be linear,

401
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
that's the beauty of these
squares,that if I have the

402
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,420
square of something and I take
its derivative I get something

403
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:04,000
linear.

404
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And this is what I get.

405
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So this is the derivative of
the error with respect to C

406
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
being zero,
and this is the derivative of

407
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
the error with respect to D
being zero.

408
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Wherever you look,
these equations keep coming.

409
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So now I guess I'm going to
solve it, what will I do,

410
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'll subtract,
I'll do elimination of course,

411
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
because that's the only thing I
know how to do.

412
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Two of these away from this
would give me -- let's see,

413
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
six, so would that be two Ds
equals one?

414
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Ha.
So it wasn't -- I was afraid
these numbers were going to come

415
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
out awful.

416
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,800
But if I take two of those away
from that, the equation I get

417
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:55,560
left is two D equals one,
so I think D is a half and C is

418
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:00,000
whatever back substitution
gives, six D is three,

419
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
so three C plus three is five,
I'm doing back substitution

420
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
now, right, three,
can I do it in light letters,

421
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
three C plus that six D is
three equals five,

422
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
so three C is two,
so I think C is two-thirds.

423
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
One-half and two-thirds.

424
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
So the best line,
the best line is the constant

425
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
two-thirds plus one-half t.

426
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And I -- is my picture more or
less right?

427
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,980
Let me write,
let me copy that best line down

428
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:55,000
again, two-thirds and a half.

429
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Let me -- I'll put in the
two-thirds and the half.

430
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
OK.

431
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So what's this P1,
that's the value at t equal to

432
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,110
one.

433
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,000
At t equal to one,
I have two-thirds plus a half,

434
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
which is -- what's that,
four-sixths and three-sixths,

435
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
so P1, oh, I promised not to
write another thing on this --

436
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'll erase P1 and I'll put
seven-sixths.

437
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
OK.

438
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And yeah, it's above one,
and e1 is one-sixth,

439
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,000
right.
You see it all.

440
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Right?
What's P2?

441
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
OK.

442
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
At point t equal to two,
where's my line here?

443
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
At t equal to two,
it's two-thirds plus one,

444
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
right?

445
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
That's five-thirds.

446
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Two-thirds and t is two,
so that's two-thirds and one

447
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
make five-thirds.

448
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And that's -- sure enough,
that's smaller than the exact

449
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
two.

450
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And then final P3,
when t is three,

451
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
oh, what's two-thirds plus
three-halves?

452
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It's the same as three-halves
plus two-thirds.

453
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It's -- so maybe four-sixths
and nine-sixths,

454
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
maybe thirteen-sixths.

455
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
OK, and again,
look, oh, look at this,

456
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
OK.

457
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You have to admire the beauty
of this answer.

458
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
What's this first error?

459
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So here are the errors.
e1, e2 and e3.

460
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
OK, what was that first error,
e1?

461
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Well, if we decide the errors
counting up, then it's

462
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
one-sixth.

463
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And the last error,
thirteen-sixths minus the

464
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
correct two is one-sixth again.

465
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And what's this error in the
middle?

466
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Let's see, the correct answer
was two, two.

467
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And we got five-thirds and it's
the other direction,

468
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
minus one-third,
minus two-sixths.

469
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
That's our error vector.

470
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
In our picture,
in our other picture,

471
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
here it is.

472
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
We just found P and e.
e is this vector,

473
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:23,000
one-sixth, minus two-sixths,
one-sixth, and P is this guy.

474
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Well, maybe I have the signs of
e wrong, I think I have,

475
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
let me fix it.

476
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Because I would like this
one-sixth -- I would like this

477
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
plus the P to give the original
b.

478
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I want P plus e to match b.

479
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So I want minus a sixth,
plus seven-sixths to give the

480
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
correct b equal one.

481
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
OK.

482
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,840
Now -- I'm going to take a deep
breath here, and ask what do we

483
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,240
know about this error vector e?

484
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,000
You've seen now this whole
problem worked completely

485
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
through, and I even think the
numbers are right.

486
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So there's P,
so let me -- I'll write --

487
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
if I can put it down here,
B is P plus e.

488
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
b I believe was one,
two, two.

489
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,060
The nearest point had
seven-sixths,

490
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,000
what were the others?

491
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Five-thirds and
thirteen-sixths.

492
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And the e vector was minus a
sixth, two-sixths,

493
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
one-third in other words,
and minus a sixth.

494
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,000
OK.
Tell me some stuff about these
two vectors.

495
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Tell me something about those
two vectors, well,

496
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
they add to b,
right, great.

497
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
OK.

498
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
What else?

499
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
What else about those two
vectors, the P,

500
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,400
the projection vector P,
and the error vector e.

501
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,780
What else do you know about
them?

502
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,000
They're perpendicular,
right.

503
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Do we dare verify that?

504
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Can you take the dot product of
those vectors?

505
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I'm like getting like minus
seven over thirty-six,

506
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
can I change that to
ten-sixths?

507
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Oh, God, come out right here.

508
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Minus seven over thirty-six,
plus twenty over thirty-six,

509
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
minus thirteen over thirty-six.

510
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Thank you, God.

511
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
OK.

512
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And what else should we know
about that vector?

513
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Actually we know -- I've got to
say we know even a little more.

514
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
This vector,
e, is perpendicular to P,

515
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
but it's perpendicular to other
stuff too.

516
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It's perpendicular not just to
this guy in the column space,

517
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
this is in the column space for
sure.

518
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
This is perpendicular to the
column space.

519
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So like give me another vector
it's perpendicular to.

520
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Another because it's
perpendicular to the whole

521
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
column space,
not just to this -- this

522
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
particular projection that's --
that is in the column space,

523
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
but it's perpendicular to other
stuff, whatever's in the column

524
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
space, so tell me another vector
in the -- oh,

525
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
well, I've written down the
matrix, so tell me another

526
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
vector in the column space.

527
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Pick a nice one.

528
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
One, one, one.

529
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
That's what everybody's
thinking.

530
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
OK, one, one,
one is in the column space.

531
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And this guy is supposed to be
perpendicular to one,

532
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,000
one, one.
Is it?

533
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Sure.
If I take the dot product with
one, one, one I get minus a

534
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:13,000
sixth, plus two-sixths,
minus a sixth,

535
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
zero.

536
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And it's perpendicular to one,
two, three.

537
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Because if I take the dot
product with one,

538
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
two, three I get minus one,
plus four, minus three,

539
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
zero again.

540
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
OK, do you see the -- I hope
you see the two pictures.

541
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
The picture here for vectors
and,

542
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,739
the picture here for the best
line, and it's the same picture,

543
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:50,000
just -- this one's in the plane
and it's showing the line,

544
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
this one never did show the
line, this -- in this picture,

545
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
C and D never showed up.

546
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
In this picture,
C and D were --

547
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,610
you know, they determined that
line.

548
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,000
But the two are exactly the
same.

549
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
C and D is the combination of
the two columns that gives P.

550
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,000
OK.
So that's these squares.

551
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And the special but most
important example of fitting by

552
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
straight line,
so the homework that's coming

553
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
then Wednesday asks you to fit
by straight lines.

554
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,200
So you're just going to end up
solving the key equation.

555
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:48,000
You're going to end up solving
that key equation and then P

556
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
will be Ax hat.

557
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
That's it.

558
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,000
OK.
Now, can I put in a little
piece of linear algebra that I

559
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
mentioned earlier,
mentioned again,

560
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
but I never did write?

561
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And I've --
I should do it right.

562
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It's about this matrix A
transpose A.

563
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
There.

564
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I was sure that that matrix
would be invertible.

565
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And of course I wanted to be
sure it was invertible,

566
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:38,000
because I planned to solve this
system with with that matrix.

567
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So and I announced like before
-- as the chapter was just

568
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:54,000
starting, I announced that it
would be invertible.

569
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But now I -- can I come back to
that?

570
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,000
OK.
So what I said was -- that if A
has independent columns,

571
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
then A transpose A is
invertible.

572
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And I would like to -- first to
repeat that important fact,

573
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
that that's the requirement
that makes everything go here.

574
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,000
It's this independent columns
of A that guarantees everything

575
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
goes through.

576
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And think why.

577
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,480
Why does this matrix A
transpose A,

578
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:53,000
why is it invertible if the
columns of A are independent?

579
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:00,000
OK, there's -- so if it wasn't
invertible, I'm -- so I want to

580
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
prove that.

581
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
If it isn't invertible,
then what?

582
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I want to reach -- I want to
follow that -- follow that line

583
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,720
--
of thinking and see what I come

584
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,000
to.

585
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Suppose, so proof.

586
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Suppose A transpose Ax is zero.

587
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm trying to prove this.

588
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
This is now to prove.

589
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I don't like hammer away at too
many proofs in this course.

590
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But this is like the central
fact and it brings in all the

591
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
stuff we know.

592
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
OK.

593
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So I'll start the proof.

594
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Suppose A transpose Ax is zero.

595
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
What -- and I'm aiming to prove
A transpose A is invertible.

596
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So what do I want to prove now?

597
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So I'm aiming to prove this
fact.

598
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'll use this,
and I'm aiming to prove that

599
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
this matrix is invertible,
OK, so if I suppose A transpose

600
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Ax is zero, then what conclusion
do I want to reach?

601
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'd like to know that x must be
zero.

602
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I want to show x must be zero.

603
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
To show now -- to prove x must
be the zero vector.

604
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,750
Is that right,
that's what we worked in the

605
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:40,000
previous chapter to understand,
that a matrix was invertible

606
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
when its null space is only the
zero vector.

607
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So that's what I want to show.

608
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:59,000
How come if A transpose Ax is
zero, how come x must be zero?

609
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
What's going to be the reason?

610
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Actually I have two ways to do
it.

611
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Let me show you one way.

612
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,670
This is -- here,
trick.

613
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:21,000
Take the dot product of both
sides with x.

614
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,920
So I'll multiply both sides by
x transpose.

615
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,000
x transpose A transpose Ax
equals zero.

616
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,610
I shouldn't have written trick.

617
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:38,000
That makes it sound like just a
dumb idea.

618
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Brilliant idea,
I should have put.

619
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
OK.

620
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I'll just put idea.

621
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
OK.

622
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Now, I got to that equation,
x transpose A transpose Ax=0,

623
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:01,000
and I'm hoping you can see the
right way to -- to look at that

624
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
equation.

625
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,000
What can I conclude from that
equation, that if I have x

626
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:16,000
transpose A -- well,
what is x transpose A transpose

627
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Ax?

628
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Does that -- what it's giving
you?

629
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
It's again going to be putting
in parentheses,

630
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I'm looking at Ax and what I
seeing here?

631
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Its transpose.

632
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So I'm seeing here this is Ax
transpose Ax.

633
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Equaling zero.

634
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Now if Ax transpose Ax,
so like let's call it y or

635
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:57,000
something, if y transpose y is
zero, what does that tell me?

636
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
That the vector has to be zero,
right?

637
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:10,380
This is the length squared,
that's the length of the vector

638
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:15,000
Ax squared,
that's Ax times Ax.

639
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
So I conclude that Ax has to be
zero.

640
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Well, I'm getting somewhere.

641
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Now that I know Ax is zero,
now I'm going to use my little

642
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
hypothesis.

643
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:43,900
Somewhere every mathematician
has to use the hypothesis.

644
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,000
Right?

645
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,090
Now, if A has independent
columns and we've -- we're at

646
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:53,000
the point where Ax is zero,
what does that tell us?

647
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I could -- I mean that could be
like a fill-in question on the

648
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
final exam.

649
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
If A has independent columns
and if Ax equals zero then what?

650
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Please say it.
x is zero, right.

651
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Which was just what we wanted
to prove.

652
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
That -- do you see why that is?

653
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
If Ax eq- equals zero,
now we're using -- here we used

654
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,290
this was the square of
something, so I'll put in little

655
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:31,000
parentheses the observation we
made, that was a square which is

656
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
zero, so the thing has to be
zero.

657
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,090
Now we're using the hypothesis
of independent columns at the A

658
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,370
has independent columns.

659
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:48,000
If A has independent columns,
this is telling me x is in its

660
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,390
null space, and the only thing
in the null space of such a

661
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,860
matrix is the zero vector.

662
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,000
OK.

663
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
So that's the argument and you
see how it really used our

664
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
understanding of the --
of the null space.

665
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
OK.

666
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,050
That's great.

667
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,000
All right.

668
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So where are we then?

669
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:24,000
That board is like the backup
theory that tells me that this

670
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:33,000
matrix had to be invertible
because these columns were

671
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,030
independent.

672
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:40,290
OK.
there's one case of independent

673
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:45,000
--
there's one case where the

674
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
geometry gets even better.

675
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,000
When the -- there's one case
when columns are sure to be

676
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
independent.

677
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And let me put that -- let me
write that down and that'll be

678
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,790
the subject for next time.

679
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:12,000
Columns are sure --
are certainly independent,

680
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:20,000
definitely independent,
if they're perpendicular.

681
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Oh, I've got to rule out the
zero column, let me give them

682
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:38,000
all length one,
so they can't be zero if they

683
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,000
are perpendicular unit vectors.

684
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Like the vectors one,
zero, zero, zero,

685
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
one, zero and zero,
zero, one.

686
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,280
Those vectors are unit vectors,
they're perpendicular,

687
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,000
and they certainly are
independent.

688
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And what's more,
suppose they're -- oh,

689
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
that's so nice,
I mean what is A transpose A

690
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
for that matrix?

691
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
For the matrix with these three
columns?

692
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It's the identity.

693
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,520
So here's the key to the
lecture that's coming.

694
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,000
If we're dealing with
perpendicular unit vectors and

695
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
the word for that will be -- see
I could have said orthogonal,

696
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
but I said perpendicular -- and
this unit vectors gets put in as

697
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
the word normal.

698
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Orthonormal vectors.

699
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Those are the best columns you
could ask for.

700
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Matrices with -- whose columns
are orthonormal,

701
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
they're perpendicular to each
other, and they're unit vectors,

702
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
well, they don't have to be
those three, let me do a final

703
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
example over here,
how about one at an angle like

704
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:11,000
that and one at ninety degrees,
that vector would be cos theta,

705
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
sine theta, a unit vector,
and this vector would be minus

706
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
sine theta cos theta.

707
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That is our absolute favorite
pair of orthonormal vectors.

708
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,610
They're both unit vectors and
they're perpendicular.

709
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:36,000
That angle is ninety degrees.

710
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So like our job next time is
first to see why orthonormal

711
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
vectors are great,
and then to make vectors

712
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
orthonormal by picking the right
basis.

713
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
OK, see you.

714
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Thanks.
