1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
OK.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Uh this is the review lecture
for the first part of the

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
course, the Ax=b part of the
course.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And the exam will emphasize
chapter three.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Because those are the --0
chapter three was about the

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
rectangular matrices where we
had null spaces and null spaces

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
of A transpose,
and ranks, and all the things

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,160
that are so clear when the
matrix is square and invertible,

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,000
they became things to think
about for rectangular matrices.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, and vector spaces and
subspaces and above all those

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,700
four subspaces.

12
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,000
OK, I'm thinking to start at
least I'll just look at old

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
exams, read out questions,
write on the board what I need

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to and we can see what the
answers are.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The first one I see is one I
can just read out.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, I'll write a little.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Suppose u, v and w are nonzero
vectors in R^7.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What are the possible -- they
span a -- a vector space.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They span a subspace of R^7,
and what are the possible

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
dimensions?

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So that's a straightforward
question, what are the possible

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
dimensions of the subspace
spanned by u,

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
v and w?

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
OK, one, two,
or three, right.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
One, two or three.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Couldn't be more because we've
only got three vectors,

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and couldn't be zero because --
because I told you the vectors

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
were nonzero.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,460
Otherwise if I allowed the
possibility that those were all

30
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:31,000
the zero vector --
then the zero-dimensional

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
subspace would have been in
there.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,000
OK.
Now can I jump to a more
serious question?

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
OK.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We have a five by three matrix.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And I'm calling it U.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm saying it's in echelon
form.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And it has three pivots,
r=3.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Three pivots.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
OK.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
First question,
what's the null space?

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What's the null space of this
matrix U, so this matrix is five

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,520
by three, and I find it helpful
to just see visually what five

43
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,000
by three means,
what that shape is.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Three columns.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Three columns in U then,
five rows, three pivots,

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and what's the null space?
Regis.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The null space of U is -- and
it asks for a spec-of course I'm

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
looking for an answer that isn't
just the definition of the null

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,470
space, but is the null space of
this matrix, with this

50
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,500
information.

51
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,000
And what is it?

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's only the zero vector.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Because we're told that the
rank is three,

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
so those three columns must be
independent, no combination --

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
of those columns is the zero
vector except -- so the only

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
thing in this null space is the
zero vector, and I --

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I could even say what that
vector is, zero,

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
zero, zero.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's OK.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So that's what's in the null
space.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
All right?
let me go on with -- this

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
question has multiple parts.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What's the -- oh now it asks
you about a ten by three matrix,

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,300
B, which is the matrix U and
two U.

65
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:40,000
It actually -- I would probably
be writing R -- and maybe I

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
should be writing R here now.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This exam goes back a few years
when I emphasized U more than R.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,670
Now, what's the echelon form
for that matrix?

69
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,000
So the echelon form,
what's the rank,

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and what's the echelon form?

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,920
Let's suppose this is in
reduced echelon form,

72
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,000
so that I could be using the
letter R.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So I'll ask for the reduced row
echelon form so imagine that

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
these are --
U is in reduced row echelon

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
form but now I've doubled the
height of the matrix,

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
what will happen when we do row
reduction?

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What row reduction will take us
to what matrix here?

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So you start doing elimination.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're doing elimination on
single rows.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But of course we're allowed to
think of blocks.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So what, well,
what's the answer look like?

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
U and z- or R -- let's -- I'll
stay with this letter U but I'm

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
really thinking it's in reduced
form, and zero.

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,760
OK.

85
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,000
Fine.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,910
Then it asks oh,
further, it asks about this

87
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,000
matrix.

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
U, U, U, and zero.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
OK, what's the echelon form of
this?

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So it's just like practice in
thinking through what would row

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
elimination, what would row
reduction do.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Have I thought this through,
so what -- what are we -- if we

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
start doing elimination,
basically we're going to

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
subtract these rows from these
--

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
so it's going to take us to U,
U, zero, and minus U,

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I guess, right?

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Take the thing all the way to R
-- let's suppose U is really R.

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Suppose that we're really going
for the reduced row echelon

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,060
form.

100
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,000
Then would we stop there?

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,500
No.

102
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,000
We would clean out,
we would -- we could use this

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,350
to -- is that right,
can I so I took this row --

104
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,000
these rows away from these to
get there.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Now I take these rows away from
these, so that gives me zero.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
There.
there?1

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And now what more would I do if
I'm really shooting for R,

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
the reduced row echelon form?

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I would -- then I want plus
ones in the pivot,

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
so I would multiply through by
minus one to get plus there.

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So essentially I'm seeing
reduced row echelon form there

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,750
and there, and there's just one
little twist still to go.

113
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,000
Do you see what that final
twist might be?

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,880
To have if -- if U is in
reduced row echelon form and now

115
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm looking at U,
U, there's one little step to

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
take, this isn't like a big deal
at all, but -- but if I really

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
want this to be in reduced form,
what would I still -- might I

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
still have to do?

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I might have some zero rows
here, I might have some zero

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
rows here that strictly should
move to the bottom.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Well, I'm not going to make a
project out of that.
first of all?

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
OK.

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What's the rank of that matrix?

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What's the rank of this matrix
C?

125
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Given that I know that the
original U has rank three,

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,840
what's the rank of this guy?

127
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,000
Six, right.

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That has rank six,
I can tell.

129
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What was -- what's the rank of
this B, while -- while we're at

130
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,000
it?
The rank of B,
is that six or three?

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Three is right.

132
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Three is right.

133
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Because we actually got it to
where we could just see three

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
pivots.

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
OK, and oh, now finally this
easy one, what's the dimension

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
of the null space -- of the null
space of C transpose?

137
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh, boy.

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
OK, so what do I -- if I want
the dimension of a null space,

139
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I want to know the size of the
matrix --

140
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
so what's the size of the
matrix C?

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It looks like it's ten by six,
is it?

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Ten by six, so C is ten by six,
so m is ten,

143
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
so C has ten rows,
C transpose has ten columns,

144
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
so there are ten columns there.

145
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,200
So how many free variables have
I got, once I --
There's quite a few trues,
shall I take a poll,

146
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,000
if I start with the ten columns
in C transpose,

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
that's the m for the original
C.

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And what do I subtract off?

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Six.
Because we said that was the
rank.

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So I'm left with four.

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Thanks.
OK.
If b is in the -- and what
would -- what does the exam say

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So I think that's the right
answer --

153
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,580
the dimension of the null space
of C transpose would be four.

154
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,000
Right.

155
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,000
OK.
Yeah.

156
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
OK.
So that's one question,
at least it brought in some --

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
some of the dimension counts.

158
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,000
OK.
Here's another type of
question.

159
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I give you an equation,
Ax equals two four two.

160
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And I give you the complete
solution.

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But I don't give you the
matrix.

162
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And another -- there's another
vector, zero,

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
zero, one.

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
OK.

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
All right.

166
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
My first question is what's the
dimension of the row space?

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Of the matrix A?

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So the main thing that you want
to get from this question is

169
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
that a question could start this
way.

170
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Sort of backward way.
so I guess I'm asking you what
is the column space for this

171
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
By giving you the answer and
not telling you what the problem

172
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
is.

173
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But we can get a lot of
information, and sometimes we

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
can get complete information
about that matrix A.

175
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,000
OK.
So what's the dimension of the
row space of A?

176
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,000
What's the rank?

177
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Tell me about what's the size
of the matrix,

178
00:12:03,000 --> 00:10:48,000
yeah, just --
These are the things we want to

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:08:28,000
think about, what's the --
what's the shape of the matrix,

180
00:07:56,000 --> 00:06:47,340
It certainly has three rows.

181
00:06:47,340 --> 00:05:25,980
But is it a- is it three by
three?

182
00:05:25,980 --> 00:03:15,000
So the (x)-s that it multiplies
have three components,

183
00:03:15,000 --> 00:04:08,000
so that --1
does the matrix have three

184
00:04:08,000 --> 00:05:00,000
columns also?

185
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

186
00:05:15,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So I'm seeing the same length
in b, three, and also in x.

187
00:08:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So A is a three by three
matrix.

188
00:10:59,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And what's its rank?

189
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,090
Its rank -- tell me something
about its null space,

190
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:00,000
I heard the right answer for
the rank, the rank is one in

191
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
this case.

192
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Why?

193
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Because the dimension of the
null space, so the dimension of

194
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
the null space of A is from
knowing that that's the complete

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
solution, it's two.

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm seeing two vectors here,
and they're independent in the

197
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
null space of A,
because they have to be in the

198
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
null space of A if I'm allowed
to throw into the solution any

199
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
amount of those vectors,
that tells me that's the null

200
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
space part then.

201
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So the dimension of the null
space is two,

202
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and then I -- of course I know
the dimensions of all the --

203
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
four subspaces.

204
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,440
Now actually it asks what's the
matrix?

205
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, what's the matrix in this
case?

206
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Do we want to -- shall I try to
figure that out?

207
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Sure.
Let's -- you'd like me to do
it, OK.

208
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So what about the matrix,
or let me at least start it,

209
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,000
OK.
If A times this x gives two,
four, two, what does that tell

210
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
me about the matrix A?

211
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
If A times that x solves that
equation then it tells me that

212
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
the first column is -- the first
column of A is -- one,

213
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
two, one, right.

214
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The first column of A has to be
one, two, one,

215
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
because if I multiply by x,
that's going to multiply just
matrix?

216
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
the first column,
and give me two,

217
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
four, two.

218
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And then I've got two more
columns to find,

219
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,630
and what information have I got
to find them with?
A basis for the null space.

220
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,000
I've got the null space.

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So the fact that this is in the
null space, what does that tell

222
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
me about the matrix?

223
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
A matrix that has zero,
zero, one in its null space?

224
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That tells me that the last
column of the matrix is zeroes.

225
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Because this is in the null
space, the last column has to be

226
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
zeroes.

227
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And because this is in the null
space, what's the second column?

228
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Well, this in the null space
means that if I multiply A by

229
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
that vector I must be getting
zeroes, so I think that better

230
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
be minus one,
minus two, and minus one.

231
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,000
OK.
That's a type of question that
just brings out the information

232
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,200
that's in that complete
solution.

233
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,000
OK.

234
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And then actually I go on to
ask what vectors -- for what

235
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
vectors B can Ax=b be solved?

236
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Ax=b can be solved if what --
so I'm looking for a condition

237
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
on b, if any.

238
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Can it be solved for every
right-hand side b?

239
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:07,000
No.

240
00:16:07,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Definitely not.

241
00:15:21,000 --> 00:14:08,000
When could it be solved?

242
00:14:08,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Well, what's the ---- I
actually say in this in the

243
00:11:35,000 --> 00:10:18,000
exam, don't just tell me.

244
00:06:38,000 --> 00:09:10,000
In the column space,
because I do know that it can

245
00:09:10,000 --> 00:11:37,000
be solved exactly when B is in
the column space,

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So what is if b has the form --
so I guess I'm asking what's

247
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
the column space of this matrix,
and what is it?

248
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's so the column space of
that matrix is all multiples b

249
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
-- b is a multiple of one,
two, one.

250
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Right?

251
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I can solve the thing if it's a
multiple of one,

252
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
two, one, and of course sure
enough --

253
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
yeah, that was a multiple of
one, two, one,

254
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and so I had a solution.

255
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So this is a case where we've
got lots of null space.

256
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Let me just recall rank is big,
don't forget those cases,

257
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
don't forget the other cases
when r is as big as it can be,

258
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
r equal m or r equal n.

259
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Those are -- we had a full
lecture on that,

260
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
the full rank,
full lecture,

261
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and important -- important
case.

262
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,000
OK.
I'll just move on.

263
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I think this is the best type
of review.

264
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's just brings these ideas
out.

265
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Apologies to the camera while I
recover glasses and exam.

266
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,000
OK.
How about a few true-false
ones?

267
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,000
Actually there won't be a
true-false on the quiz.

268
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But it gives us a moment of
quick review.

269
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Here's one.

270
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If the null space -- I have a
square matrix.

271
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
If its null space is just the
zero vector, what about the null

272
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
space of A transpose?

273
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
If the null space of A is just
the zero vector,

274
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and the matrix is square,
what do I know about the null

275
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
space of A transpose?

276
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Also the zero vector.

277
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Good.

278
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And that's a very very
important fact.

279
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
OK.

280
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
How about this?

281
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
These -- look at the space of
five by five matrices as a

282
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
vector space.

283
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So it's actually a
twenty-five-dimensional vector

284
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
space.

285
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
All five by five matrices.

286
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Look at the invertible
matrices.

287
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Do they form a subspace?

288
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So I have this five by --
a space of all five by five

289
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
matrices.

290
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,640
I can add them,
I can multiply by numbers.

291
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,810
But now I narrow down to the
invertible ones.

292
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,000
And I ask are they a subspace?

293
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And you -- your answer is --
quiet, but nevertheless

294
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
definite, no.

295
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,110
Right?

296
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,000
No.

297
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Because if I add two invertible
matrices I have no idea if the

298
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
answer is invertible.

299
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If I multiply that invertible
-- well, it doesn't even have

300
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
the zero matrix in it,
it couldn't be a subspace.

301
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I have to be able to multiply
by zero --

302
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and stay in my subspace,
and the invertible ones

303
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
wouldn't work.

304
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Well, the singular ones
wouldn't work either.

305
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
They have zero -- the zero
matrix is in the singular

306
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
matrices, but if I add two
singular matrices I don't know

307
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
if the answer is singular or
not.

308
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,000
OK.
So another true-false.

309
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
If b squared equals zero then b
equals zero.

310
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
True or false?

311
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If b squared equals zero,
true, false?

312
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,000
b squared equals zero,
b has to be a square --

313
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
square matrix,
so that I can multiply it by

314
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
itself, does that imply that B
is zero?

315
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Are there matrices whose square
could be the zero matrix?

316
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yes or no?

317
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yes there are.

318
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
There are matrices whose square
is the zero matrix.

319
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So this statement is false.

320
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
If b squared is zero,
we don't know that b is zero.

321
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
For example -- the best example
is that matrix.

322
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That matrix is a dangerous
matrix.

323
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It will come up in later parts
of this course as an example of

324
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
what can go wrong.

325
00:21:47,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And here is a real simple -- so
this -- so if I square that

326
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:12,000
matrix, I do get the zero
matrix,and it shows --

327
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
OK.

328
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,860
A system of m equations in m
unknowns is solvable for every

329
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:27,040
right-hand side if the columns
are independent.

330
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,000
OK.

331
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So can I say that again,
I'm -- I'll write it down then

332
00:22:34,000 --> 00:20:45,000
for short.
m by m matrix independent

333
00:20:45,000 --> 00:16:58,000
columns then the question is
does Ax=b, is it always

334
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:18,000
solvable?

335
00:16:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And the answer is -- yes or no
-- right.

336
00:13:25,000 --> 00:08:53,000
OK, which -- did you watch that
quiz, there was a quiz program

337
00:08:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
on TV for a few weeks,
did you see that,

338
00:05:59,000 --> 00:03:09,800
what was the name of that --2
winning a million dollars or

339
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,000
something?

340
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
How to be a millionaire?

341
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It was some crazy guy,
what was his name?

342
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's -- Regis,
right.

343
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
OK.2

344
00:03:25,000 --> 00:07:00,000
If you saw this,
like when you should have been

345
00:07:00,000 --> 00:11:42,180
doing linear algebra of course
-- but I didn't have to do the

346
00:11:42,180 --> 00:16:09,000
homework, so I was watching it,
so there were three -- the

347
00:16:09,000 --> 00:20:50,000
interesting -- the novel point
was there were three ways that

348
00:20:50,000 --> 00:23:44,500
you could get help,
right --

349
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,000
but you could only use each way
once, so you couldn't like use

350
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
them all the time.

351
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So remember that?

352
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You could -- so you could poll
the audience,

353
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,520
and that was a very -- that was
a hundred percent successful

354
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,000
way, so I'll poll the audience
on this.

355
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
If the other possibility --
another possibility you could

356
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
call your friend,
right, or he's your friend

357
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
until he gives you the wrong
answer, which -- that turned out

358
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
to be very unreliable,
you know, you'd call up your

359
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,710
brother or something and ask him
for the capital of whatever,

360
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,000
Bosnia.

361
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What does he know,
he makes some guess,

362
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:34,000
matrix, independent columns,
is Ax=b always solvable?

363
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Maybe just hands up for that?

364
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
A few.

365
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And who says no?

366
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Oh, gosh, this audience is not
reliable.

367
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Fifty fifty.

368
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I guess I'd say,
I'd vote yes.

369
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Because independent columns,
that means that the rank is the

370
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
full size m, I have a matrix of
rank m.

371
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
That means it's -- I mean it's
square, so it's an invertible

372
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
matrix, and nothing could go
wrong.

373
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yes.

374
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So that's the good case and we
always expect it in chapter two,

375
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,000
but of course chapter three is
-- only one of the

376
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
possibilities.

377
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,000
OK.
Let me move on to another
question from an old quiz.

378
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
OK.

379
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,000
OK.
Let's see.

380
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:42,000
OK.

381
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:52,280
I'm going to give you a matrix,
but I'm going to give it to you

382
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:58,000
as a product of a couple of
matrices, one,

383
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
one, zero, zero,
one, zero, one,

384
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
zero, one, times another
matrix, one, zero,

385
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
minus one, two,
zero, one, one,

386
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
minus one, and all zeroes.

387
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:05,000
OK.

388
00:26:05,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I would like to ask you
questions about that matrix

389
00:21:55,000 --> 00:17:10,000
without doing the multiplication
and finding the matrix b.

390
00:17:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Can you tell me something -- so
I'll ask questions about this

391
00:12:10,000 --> 00:06:45,000
matrix b and I'll answer them
without multiplying it out.2

392
00:06:45,000 --> 00:11:38,000
For example,
I'm going to ask you for a

393
00:11:38,000 --> 00:14:52,000
basis for the null space.

394
00:18:21,170 --> 00:22:59,000
So I'm going to solve Bx equals
zero.

395
00:22:59,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So give me a basis for --
for the null space of B.

396
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Let's see, what dimension I in
-- the null space of B is a

397
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
subspace of R.

398
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
What size vectors I looking for
here?

399
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Because if we don't know the
size, we aren't going to find

400
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,320
it, right?
the null -- this matrix is

401
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,000
three by four obviously.

402
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So if we're looking for the
null space we're looking for

403
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
those vectors x in R^4.

404
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
OK.

405
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So the null space of B is
certainly a subspace of R^4.

406
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,940
What do you think its dimension
is?

407
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,000
Of course once we find the
basis we would know the

408
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
dimension immediately,
but let's stop first,

409
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
what's the rank of this matrix
B?

410
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Let's see, what -- is that
matrix invertible,

411
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
that square one there?

412
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Let's say sure,
I think it is,

413
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
yes, that matrix B looks
invertible.

414
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Is that pretty clear?

415
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yeah.

416
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yeah.
So I've gone wrong in this
course already,

417
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
but I'll still hope that that
matrix is invertible.

418
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah, yeah, because if I look
for a combination of those three

419
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
columns --
well, I couldn't use this

420
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
middle column because it would
have a one and in a position

421
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
that I -- column is otherwise
all zero, so a combination that

422
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
gives zero can't give us that
problem, and then the other two

423
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
are clearly independent sets --
so that matrix is invertible.

424
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Later we could take a
determinant or other things.

425
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,500
OK.

426
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,990
What's the setup?

427
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,000
If I have an invertible matrix,
a nice invertible square

428
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
matrix, times this guy,
times this second factor,

429
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and I'm looking for the null
space, does this have any

430
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
effect?

431
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Is the null -- so what I'm
asking is is the null space of B

432
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
the same as the null space of
just this part?

433
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I think so.

434
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I think so.

435
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
If Bx is zero,
then multiplying by that guy

436
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,500
I'll still have zero.

437
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:53,000
But also if this times some x
give zero, I could always

438
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
multiply on the left by the
inverse of that,

439
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
because it is invertible,
and I would discover that this

440
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
kind of Bx is zero.

441
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
You want me to write some of
that down --

442
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
if I have a product here,
C times -- times D,

443
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
say, and if C is invertible,
the null space of CD,

444
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,600
well, it will the same as the
null space of D.

445
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,000
If C is invertible.

446
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,040
Multiplying by an invertible
matrix on the left can't change

447
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,000
the null space.

448
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
OK.

449
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
So basically I'm asking you for
the null space of this.
so when do I know -- well,
I would say suppose the matrix

450
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I don't have to do the
multiplication because I have C

451
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
is invertible.

452
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,520
That first factor C is
invertible.

453
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,000
It's not going to change the
null space.

454
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,900
OK.

455
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:02,000
So can we just write down a
basis now for the null space?

456
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
So what's the basis for the
null space of -- of that?

457
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So basis for the null space I'm
looking for the two -- there are

458
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
two pivot columns obviously.

459
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,500
It clearly has rank two.

460
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm looking for the two special
solutions.

461
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
They'll come from the third and
the fourth.

462
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The free variables.

463
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
OK.
so if the third free variable

464
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
is a one, then I think probably
I need a minus one there and a

465
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
one there, it looks like.

466
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Do you agree that if I then do
that multiplication I'll get

467
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,000
zero?
And if I have one in the fourth
variable, then maybe I need a

468
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,000
one in the second variable and
maybe a minus two in the third.

469
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So I just reasoned that through
and then if I look back I see

470
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
sure enough that the free
variable part that I sometimes

471
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,090
call F, that up --
that two by two corner,

472
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:08,000
is sitting here with all its
signs reversed.

473
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So that's -- here I'm seeing
minus F, and here I'm seeing the

474
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,410
identity in the null space
matrix.

475
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:23,000
OK, so that's the null space.

476
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Another question is solve Bx
equal one, zero,

477
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
one.

478
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,000
OK.
So that's one question,
now solve complete solutions.

479
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
To Bx equal one,
zero, one.

480
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,000
OK.
Yeah, so I guess I'm seeing if
I wanted to get one,

481
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
zero, one -
What's our particular solution?

482
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So I'm looking for a particular
solution and then the null space

483
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,000
part.
OK.

484
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:08,000
I-- actually the first column
of B, so what's the first column

485
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
of our matrix B?

486
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,880
It's the vector one,
zero, one.

487
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,000
The first column of our matrix
agrees with the right-hand side.

488
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So I guess I'm thinking x
particular plus x null space

489
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
will be the particular solution,
since the first column of B is

490
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,580
exactly right,
that's great.

491
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:35,000
And then I have C times that
first null space vector and D

492
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
times the other null space
vector.

493
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Right?

494
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The two -- the null space part
of the solution,

495
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
as always has the arbitrary
constants, the particular

496
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
solution doesn't have any
arbitrary constants,

497
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
it's one particular solution,
and in this case it'll --

498
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
that one would do.

499
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,000
OK.
Fine.
so those are questions taken

500
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:13,000
from old quizzes,
any questions coming to mind?

501
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah.

502
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Q: value.

503
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,000
OK.
Well, so that particular x
particular, it says that let's

504
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:33,000
see, when I multiply by this
guy, I'm going to get the first

505
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
column of B.

506
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
That --
if that's a solution,

507
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I multiply B,
B times this x will be the

508
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
first column of B,
and so I'm saying that the

509
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
first column of this B agrees
with the right-hand side.

510
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So I'm saying that look at the
first column of that matrix B.

511
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
If you do the multiplication,
it's -- so what's the first

512
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
column of that matrix?

513
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Is that how you do that
multiplication?

514
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I multiply that matrix by that
first column.

515
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And it picks out one,
zero, one.

516
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So the first column of B is
exactly that.

517
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And therefore a particular
solution will be this guy.

518
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah.

519
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,950
OK.

520
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,000
Yes.

521
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Q: particular solution.

522
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Any of the solutions can be the
particular one that we pick out.

523
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So like this plus -- plus this
would be another particular

524
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
solution.

525
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It would be another solution.

526
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,930
The particular is just telling
us only take one.

527
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:03,000
But it's not telling us which
one we have to take.

528
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
We take the most convenient
one.

529
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I guess in this -- in this
problem that was that one.

530
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,360
Good.

531
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,000
Other questions?

532
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yes.

533
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And this pattern of particular
plus null space,

534
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
of course, that's going
throughout mathematics of linear

535
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
systems.

536
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
We're really doing mathematics
of linear systems here.

537
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Our systems are discrete and
they're finite-dimensional --

538
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and so it's linear algebra,
but this particular plus null

539
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
space goes -- that doesn't
depend on having finite matrices

540
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
-- that spreads much -- that
spreads everywhere.

541
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,920
OK, I'm going to just like to
encourage you to take problems

542
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,000
out of the book,
let me do the same myself.

543
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
OK well here's some easy true
or falses.

544
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I don't know why the author put
these in here.

545
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,000
OK.
If m=n, then the row space
equals the column space.

546
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So these are true or falses.

547
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
If m equals n,
so that means the matrix is

548
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
square, then the row space
equals the column space?

549
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
False, good.

550
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,490
Good, what is equal there?

551
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:31,000
What can I say is equal,
if M -- well,

552
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,000
yeah.
Yeah it -- so that's definitely
false --

553
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
the row space and the column
space, and this matrix is like

554
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
always a good example to
consider.

555
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So there's a square matrix but
it's row space is the multiples

556
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
of zero, one,
and its column space is the

557
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
multiples of one,
zero.

558
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Very different.

559
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
The row space and the column
space are totally different for

560
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
that matrix.

561
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Now of course if the matrix was
symmetric, well,

562
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
then clearly the row space
equals the column space.

563
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,000
OK.
How about this question?

564
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
The matrices A and minus A
share the same four subspaces?

565
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Do the matrices A and minus A
have the same column space,

566
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
do they have the same null
space, do they have the same row

567
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,000
space?
What's the answer on that?

568
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Yes or no.

569
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Yes.
Good.

570
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,000
OK.
How about this?

571
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,200
If A and B have the same four
subspaces, then A is a multiple

572
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,000
of B.

573
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
If -- suppose those subspaces
are the same.

574
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Then is A a multiple of B?

575
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,130
OK.

576
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:53,000
How how do you answer a
question like that?

577
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Of course if you want to answer
it yes, then I would --

578
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
then they'd have to think of a
reason why.

579
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
If you want to answer no way,
then you would -- and I would

580
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
sort of like first I would try
to think no, I would say can I

581
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
come up with an example where it
isn't true?

582
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Let me repeat the question.

583
00:39:20,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And then write the answer.

584
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:19,000
OK.

585
00:35:19,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So I'll repeat that question.

586
00:31:19,000 --> 00:24:07,000
If -- so true or false,
if A and B have the same four

587
00:24:07,000 --> 00:18:44,000
subspaces, then A is some
multiple of B.

588
00:18:44,000 --> 00:13:04,000
True or false,
how do you feel about it at

589
00:13:04,000 --> 00:09:54,000
this instant?3

590
00:15:12,390 --> 00:17:51,000
so how many think true?

591
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:12,000
OK.

592
00:18:12,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I gave you every chance to
think about that.

593
00:23:09,000 --> 00:24:19,190
Let's see.

594
00:24:19,190 --> 00:30:39,000
So what -- I would just take
extreme cases if it was me,

595
00:37:07,000 --> 00:40:23,000
is invertible --
suppose A is an invertible

596
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
matrix, then what -- suppose
it's six by six invertible

597
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
matrix, then what's its row
space, and its column space is

598
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
all of R^6, and the null space,
and the null space of A

599
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
transpose would be the zero
vector.

600
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
So every invertible matrix is
going to give that answer.

601
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
If I have a six by six
invertible matrix,

602
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,800
I know what those subspaces
are.

603
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:58,000
Heck, that was back in chapter
two, when I didn't even know

604
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
what subspaces were.

605
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
The row space and column space
are both all six-dimensional

606
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
space --
the whole space,

607
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
and the rank is six,
in other words,

608
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
and the null spaces have zero
dimension.

609
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So do you see now the answer?

610
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So A and B could be.

611
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So A and B could be for example
any -- so I'm going to say

612
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,000
false.
Because A and B for example --
So an example:

613
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
A and B any invertible six by
six, six by six.

614
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So those would have the same
four subspaces but they wouldn't

615
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
be the same.

616
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Of course th- there should be
something about those matrices

617
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
that would be the same.

618
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It's sort of a natural problem,
so now actually we're getting

619
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
to a math question.

620
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
The answer is this is not true.

621
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
One matrix doesn't have to be a
multiple of the other.

622
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
But there must be something
that's true.

623
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And that would be sort of like
a natural question to ask.

624
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:27,000
If they have the same
subspaces, same four subspaces,

625
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:38,000
then what -- what could you --
instinct wasn't necessarily

626
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
right.

627
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But I hope you now see that the
correct answer is false.

628
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And then you might think OK,
well, they certainly do have

629
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
the same rank.

630
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,620
But do -- obviously if they
have the same four subspaces,

631
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,000
they have the same rank.

632
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I might say if they have the
well, I could extend that

633
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,000
question and think about other
possibilities and finally come

634
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
up with something that was true.

635
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
But I won't press that one.

636
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Let me keep going with practice
questions.

637
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And these practice questions
are quite appropriate I think

638
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
for the exam.

639
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,210
OK.
let's see.

640
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:31,960
If I exchange two rows of A
which subspaces stay the same?

641
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:37,000
So I'm trying to take out
questions that we can answer

642
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,250
without you know we can answer
quickly.

643
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:47,000
If I have a matrix A,
and I exchange two of its rows,

644
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
which subspaces stay the same?

645
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
The row space does stay the
same.

646
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And the null space stays the
same.

647
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Good.
Good.

648
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Correct.

649
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Column space would be a wrong
answer.

650
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,850
OK.
all right, here's a question.

651
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:12,000
Oh, this leads into the next
chapter.

652
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Why can the vector one,
two, three not be a row and

653
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
also in the null space?

654
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Fitting we close with this
question.

655
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Close is --
so V equal this one,

656
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:38,000
two, three can't be in the null
space of a matrix and the row

657
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
space.

658
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And my question is why not?

659
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Why not?

660
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:51,710
So this is a question that we
can because it's sort of asked

661
00:44:51,710 --> 00:45:00,000
in a straightforward way,
we can figure out an answer.

662
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Well, actually yeah -- I'll
even pin it down,

663
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
it can't be in the null space
-- and be a row.

664
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I'll even pin it down further.

665
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Ask it to be a row of A.

666
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Why not?

667
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So I'm -- we know the
dimensions of these spaces.

668
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But now I'm asking you sort of
like the overlap between -- so

669
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,000
the null space and the row
space, those are in the same

670
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
n-dimensional space.

671
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Those are -- well,
those are both subspaces of

672
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
n-dimensional space,
and I'm basically saying they

673
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
can't overlap.

674
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I can't have a vector like
this, a typical vector,

675
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
that's in the null space and
it's also a row of the matrix.

676
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Why is that?

677
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So that's a new sort of idea.

678
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Let's just see what it would
mean.

679
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I mean that A times this V,
why can this A times this V it

680
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,040
can't be zero.

681
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,000
Oh well, if it's zero,
so this is -- I'm getting it

682
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
into the null space here.

683
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So this is -- now let's put
that vector's in the null space,

684
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
why can't the first row of a
matrix be one,

685
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
two, three?

686
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I can fill out the matrix as I
like.

687
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Why is that impossible?

688
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:45,250
Well, you're seeing it's
impossible, right?

689
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:49,000
That if that was a row of the
matrix and in the null space,

690
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
that number would not be zero,
it would be fourteen.

691
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Right.
So now we actually are
beginning to get a more complete

692
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
picture of these four subspaces.

693
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
The two that are over in
n-dimensional space,

694
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
they actually only share the
zero vector.

695
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
The intersection of the null
space and the row space is only

696
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
the zero vector.

697
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And in fact the null space is
perpendicular to the row space.

698
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
That'll be the first topic
let's see, we have a holiday

699
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Monday --
and I'll see you Wednesday with

700
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,660
perpendiculars.

701
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,000
And I'll see you Friday.

702
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So good luck on the quiz.
