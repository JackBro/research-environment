1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,230
Okay.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,000
This lecture is mostly about
the idea of similar matrixes.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm going to tell you what that
word similar means and in what

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
way two matrixes are called
similar.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But before I do that,
I have a little more to say

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
about positive definite
matrixes.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You can tell this is a subject
I

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
think is really important and I
told you what positive definite

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
meant -- it means that this --
this expression,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
this quadratic form,
x transpose I x is always

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
positive.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But the direct way to test it
was with eigenvalues or pivots

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
or determinants.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So I --
we know what it means,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
we know how to test it,
but I didn't really say where

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
positive definite matrixes come
from.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And so one thing I want to say
is that they come from least

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
squares in -- and all sorts of
physical problems start with a

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
rectangular
matrix -- well,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
you remember in least squares
the crucial combination was A

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
transpose A.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So I want to show that that's a
positive definite matrix.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Can -- so I -- I'm going to
speak a little more about

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
positive definite matrixes,
just recapping -- so let me ask

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
a
question.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It may be on the homework.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Suppose a matrix A is positive
definite.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,380
I mean by that it's all -- I'm
assuming it's symmetric.

29
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,000
That's always built into the
definition.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So we have a symmetric positive
definite matrix.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What about its inverse?

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Is the inverse of a symmetric
positive definite matrix also

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
symmetric positive definite?

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So you quickly think,
okay, what do I know about the

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
pivots of the inverse matrix?

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Not much.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What do I know about the
eigenvalues of the inverse

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
matrix?

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Everything, right?

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The eigenvalues of the inverse
are one over the eigenvalues of

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
the matrix.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,540
So if my matrix starts out
positive definite,

43
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,000
then right away I know that its
inverse is positive definite,

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
because those positive
eigenvalues -- then one over the

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
eigenvalue is
also positive.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What if I know that A -- a
matrix A and a matrix B are both

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
positive definite?

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,690
But let me ask you this.

49
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:03,000
Suppose if A and B are positive
definite, what about -- what

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
about A plus B?

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
In some way,
you hope that that would be

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
true.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's -- positive definite for a
matrix is kind of like positive

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
for a real number.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But we don't know the
eigenvalues of A plus B.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We don't know the pivots of A
plus B.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,410
So we just, like,
have to go down this list of,

58
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,000
all right, which approach to
positive definite can we get a

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,610
handle on?

60
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,000
And this is a good one.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This is a good one.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Can we -- how would we decide
that -- if A was like this and

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
if B was like this,
then we would look at x

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,460
transpose A plus B x.

65
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sure this is in the
homework.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now -- so we have x transpose A
x

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,660
bigger than zero,
x transpose B x positive for

68
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,000
all -- for all x,
so now I ask you about this

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
guy.
And of course,
you just add that and that and

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
we get what we want.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If A and B are positive
definites, so is A plus B.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So that's what I've shown.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So is A plus B.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Just -- be sort of ready for
all the approaches through

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
eigenvalues and through this
expression.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And now, finally,
one more thought about positive

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
definite is this combination
that came up in least squares.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Can I do that?

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So now -- now suppose A is
rectangular, m by n.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I -- so I'm sorry that I've
used

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
the same letter A for the
positive definite matrixes in

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
the eigenvalue chapter that I
used way back in earlier

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
chapters when the matrix was
rectangular.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Now, that matrix -- a
rectangular matrix,

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,520
no way its positive definite.

86
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,000
It's not symmetric.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's not even square in
general.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But you remember that the key
for these rectangular ones was A

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
transpose A.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's square.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's symmetric.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Those are things we knew -- we
knew back when we met this thing

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
in the least square stuff,
in the projection stuff.

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But now we know something more
-- we can ask a more important

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
question, a deeper question --
is it positive definite?

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And we sort of hope so.

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Like, we -- we might -- in
analogy with numbers,

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
this is like -- sort of like
the square of a number,

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and that's positive.

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So now I want to ask the matrix
question.

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Is A transpose
A positive definite?

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay, now it's -- so again,
it's a rectangular A that I'm

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
starting with,
but it's the combination A

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
transpose A that's the square,
symmetric and hopefully

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
positive definite matrix.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So how -- how do I see that it
is positive definite,

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
or at least positive
semi-definite?

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You'll see that.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,830
Well, I don't know the
eigenvalues of this product.

110
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't want to work with the
pivots.

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The right thing -- the right
quantity to look at is this,

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,630
x transpose Ax -- A -- x
transpose times my matrix

113
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,000
times x.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,140
I'd like to see that this thing
-- that that expression is

115
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,000
always positive.

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm not doing it with numbers,
I'm doing it with symbols.

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,990
Do you see -- how do I see that
that expression comes out

118
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,000
positive?

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm taking a rectangular matrix
A

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,030
and an A transpose -- that
gives me something square

121
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,000
symmetric, but now I want to see
that if I multiply -- that if I

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
do this -- I form this quadratic
expression that I get this

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
positive thing that goes upwards
when I graph it.

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,130
How do I see that that's
positive,

125
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,000
or absolutely it isn't negative
anyway?

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We'll have to,
like, spend a minute on the

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
question could it be zero,
but it can't be negative.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why can this never be negative?

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The argument is -- like the one
key idea in so many steps in

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
linear algebra -- put those
parentheses

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
in a good way.

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,840
Put the parentheses around Ax
and what's the first part?

133
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,000
What's this x transpose A
transpose?

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That is Ax transpose.

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So what do we have?

136
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We have the length squared of
Ax.

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
We have -- that's the column
vector Ax that's the row

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
vector Ax, its length squared,
certainly greater than or

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
possibly equal to zero.

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So we have to deal with this
little possibility.

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Could it be equal?

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,650
Well, when could the length
squared be zero?

143
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,000
Only if the vector is zero,
right?

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's the only vector that has
length squared zero.

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So we have -- we would like to
-- I would like to get that

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,030
possibility out of there.

147
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,000
So I want to have Ax never --
never be zero,

148
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
except of course for the zero
vector.

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
How do I assure that Ax is
never zero?

150
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The -- in other words,
how do I show that there's no

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,910
null space of A?

152
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,000
The rank should be -- so now
remember -- what's the rank when

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
there's no null space?

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
By no null space,
you know what I mean.

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Only the zero vector in the
null space.

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So if I have a --
if I have an 11 by 5 matrix --

157
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
so it's got 11 rows,
5 columns, when is there no

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
null space?

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,470
So the columns should be
independent -- what's the rank?

160
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,920
n 5 -- rank n.

161
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,580
Independent columns,
when -- so if I -- then I

162
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,790
conclude yes,
positive definite.

163
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:21,350
And this was the assumption --
then A transpose A is

164
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:27,000
invertible -- the least squares
equations all work fine.

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And more than that -- the
matrix is even positive

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
definite.

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And I just to say one comment
about numerical things,

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
with a positive definite
matrix,

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
you never have to do row
exchanges.

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You never run into unsuitably
small numbers or zeroes in the

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
pivot position.

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
They're the right -- they're
the great matrixes to compute

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
with, and they're the great
matrixes to study.

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So that's -- I wanted to take
this first ten

175
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
minutes of grab the first ten
minutes away from similar

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
matrixes and continue a -- this
much more with positive

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
definite.

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm really at this point,
now, coming close to the end of

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the heart of linear algebra.

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The positive definiteness
brought everything together.

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Similar matrixes,
which is coming the rest of

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
this hour is a key topic,
and please come on Monday.

183
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Monday is about what's called
the SVD, singular values.

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's the -- has become a
central fact in -- a central

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
part of linear algebra.

186
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I mean, you can come after
Monday

187
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
also, but -- Monday is,
-- that singular value thing

188
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
has made it into this course.

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Ten years ago,
five years ago it wasn't in the

190
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
course, now it has to be.

191
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,790
Okay.

192
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,000
So can I begin today's
lecture proper with this idea

193
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
of similar matrixes.

194
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
This is what similar matrixes
mean.

195
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So here -- let's start again.

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll write it again.

197
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So A and B are similar.

198
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
A and B are -- now I'm -- these
matrixes -- I'm no longer

199
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
talking about symmetric
matrixes,

200
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
in -- at least no longer
expecting symmetric matrixes.

201
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm talking about two square
matrixes n by n.

202
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,380
A and B, they're n by n
matrixes.

203
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,000
And I'm introducing this word
similar.

204
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So I'm going to say what does
it mean?

205
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,160
It means that they're connected
in the way --

206
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:14,000
well, in the way I've written
here, so let me rewrite it.

207
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That means that for some matrix
M, which has to be invertible,

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,000
because you'll see that -- this
one matrix is -- take the other

209
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
matrix, multiply on the right by
M and on the left by M inverse.

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So the question is,
why that combination?

211
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But part of the answer you know
already.

212
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You remember -- we've done this
-- we've taken a matrix A -- so

213
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
let's do an example of similar.

214
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Suppose A -- the matrix A --
suppose it has a

215
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
full set of eigenvectors.

216
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,930
They go in this eigenvector
matrix S.

217
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,000
Then what was the main point of
the whole -- the main

218
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
calculation of the whole chapter
was -- is -- use that

219
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
eigenvector matrix S and its
inverse comes over there to

220
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
produce the nicest possible
matrix lambda.

221
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Nicest possible because it's
diagonal.

222
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So in our new language,
this is saying A is similar to

223
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
lambda.

224
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,160
A is similar to lambda,
because there is a matrix,

225
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:57,000
and this particular -- there is
an M and this particular M is

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
this important guy,
this eigenvector

227
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
matrix.

228
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But if I take a different
matrix M and I look at M inverse

229
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
A M, the result won't come out
diagonal, but it will come out a

230
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,370
matrix B that's similar to A.

231
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:25,590
Do you see that I'm -- what I'm
doing is, like -- I'm putting

232
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,000
these matrixes into families.

233
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
All the matrixes in one -- in
the family are similar to each

234
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,000
other.
They're all -- each one in this
family is connected to each

235
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
other one by some matrix M and
the -- like the outstanding

236
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,540
member of the family is the
diagonal guy.

237
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:53,000
I mean, that's the simplest,
neatest matrix in this family

238
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
of all the matrixes that are
similar to A,

239
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
the best one is lambda.

240
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,250
But there are lots of others,
because I can take different --

241
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,000
instead of S,
I can take any old matrix M,

242
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
any old invertible matrix and
-- and do it.

243
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'd better do an example.

244
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Okay.
Suppose I take A as the
matrix two one one two.

245
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Okay.
Do you know the eigenvalue
matrix for that?

246
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The eigenvalues of that matrix
are -- well, three and one.

247
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So that -- and the eigenvectors
would be easy to find.

248
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So this matrix is similar to
this one.

249
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But my point is -- but also,
I can also take my matrix,

250
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
two one one two,
I could multiply it by -- let's

251
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
see, what -- I'm just going to
cook up a matrix M here.

252
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm -- I'll -- let me just
invent -- one four one zero.

253
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And over here I'll put M
inverse, and because I happened

254
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
to make that triangular,
I know that its inverse is

255
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
that, right?

256
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So there's M inverse A M,
that's going to produce some

257
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
matrix -- oh,
well, I've got to do the

258
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
multiplication,
so hang on a second,

259
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
let -- I'll just copy that one
minus four zero one and multiply

260
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
these guys so I'm getting two
nine one

261
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and six, I think.

262
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Can you check it as I go,
because you -- see I'm just --

263
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
so that's two minus four,
I'm getting a minus two nine

264
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
minus 24 is a minus 15,
my God, how did I get this?

265
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And that's probably one and
six.

266
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So there's my matrix B.

267
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And there's my matrix lambda,
there's my matrix A and my

268
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,220
point is these are all similar
matrixes.

269
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:13,000
They all have something in
common, besides being just two

270
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
by two.

271
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
They have something in common.

272
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And that's -- and what is it?

273
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
What's the point about two
matrixes that are built out of

274
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,660
-- the B is built out of M
inverse A M.

275
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,000
What is it that A and B have in
common?

276
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That's the main -- now I'm
telling you the main fact about

277
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,070
similar matrixes.

278
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,000
They have the same eigenvalues.

279
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
This is -- this chapter is
about eigenvalues,

280
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and that's why we're interested
in this family of matrixes that

281
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
have the same eigenvalues.

282
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What are the eigenvalues in
this example?

283
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Lambda.

284
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
The eigenvalues of that I could
compute.

285
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The eigenvalues of that I can
compute really fast.

286
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So the eigenvalues are three
and one -- for this for sure.

287
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Now did we -- do you see why
the eigenvalues are

288
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,050
three and one for that one?

289
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,000
If I tell you the eigenvalues
are three and one,

290
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
you prick -- quickly process
the trace, which is -- and four

291
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
-- agrees with four and you
process the determinant,

292
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
three times one -- the
determinant is three and you say

293
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
yes, it's right.

294
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,840
Now I'm hoping that the
eigenvalues of this thing are

295
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,000
three and one.

296
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
May I process the trace and the
determinant for that one?

297
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What's the trace here?

298
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,210
The trace of this matrix is
four minus two and six,

299
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,000
and that's what it should be.

300
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What's the determinant minus
twelve

301
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,970
plus fifteen is three.

302
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,000
The determinant is three.

303
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The eigenvalues of that matrix
are also three and one.

304
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And you see I created this
matrix just like -- I just took

305
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,130
any M, like, one that popped
into my head and computed M

306
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:21,000
inverse A M, got that matrix,
it didn't look anything special

307
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:30,060
but it's -- like A itself,
it has those eigenvalues three

308
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,000
and one.

309
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So that's the main fact and let
me write it down.

310
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Similar matrixes have the same
eigenvalues.

311
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So I'll just put that as an
important point.

312
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And think
why.

313
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Why is that?

314
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,530
So that's what that family of
matrixes is.

315
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:04,000
The matrixes that are similar
to this A here are all the

316
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
matrixes with eigenvalues three
and one.

317
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Every matrix with eigenvalues
three and one,

318
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
there's some M that connects
this guy to the one you think

319
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
of.

320
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And then of course,
the most special guy in the

321
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,840
whole family is the diagonal one
with eigenvalues three and one

322
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,000
sitting there on the diagonal.

323
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But also, I could find -- I
mean, tell me just a couple more

324
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
members of the family.

325
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Another -- tell me another
matrix that has

326
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
eigenvalues three and one.

327
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Well, let's see,
I -- oh, I'll just make it

328
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
triangular.

329
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That's in the family.

330
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
There is some M that -- that
connects to this one.

331
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And -- and also this.

332
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
There's some matrix M -- so
that M inverse A M comes out to

333
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
be that.

334
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,090
There's a whole family here.

335
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,000
And they all share the same
eigenvalues.

336
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
So why is that?

337
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Okay.
I'm going to start -- the only
possibility is to start with Ax

338
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
equal lambda x.

339
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Okay, so suppose A has the
eigenvalue lambda.

340
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Now I want to get B into the
picture here somehow.

341
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You remember B is M inverse A
M.

342
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Let's just remember that over
here.

343
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
B is M inverse A M.

344
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And I want to see its
eigenvalues.

345
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
How I going to get M inverse A
M into this equation?

346
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Let me just sort of do it.

347
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'll put an M times an M
inverse in there,

348
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
right?

349
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That was -- I haven't changed
the

350
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
left-hand side,
so I better not change the

351
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
right-hand side.

352
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So everybody's okay so far,
I just put in there -- see,

353
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I want to get a -- so now I'll
multiply on the left by M

354
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
inverse -- I have to do the same
to this side and that number

355
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
lambda's just a number,
so it factors out in the front.

356
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So what I have here is this was
safe.

357
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I did the same thing to both
sides.

358
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,520
And now I've got B.

359
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,000
There's B.

360
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That's B times this vector M
inverse x is equal to lambda

361
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
times this vector M inverse x.

362
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,560
So what have I learned?

363
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:54,000
I've learned that B times some
vector is lambda times that

364
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
vector.

365
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I've learned that lambda is an
eigenvalue of B also.

366
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So this is -- if -- so this is
-- if lambda's an eigenvalue of

367
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
A, then I can write it this way
and I discover that lambda's an

368
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
eigenvalue of B.

369
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
That's the end of the proof.

370
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The eigenvector didn't stay the
same.

371
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,580
Of course I don't expect the
eigenvectors to stay the same.

372
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,000
If all the eigenvalues are the
same and all the eigenvectors

373
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
are the same,
then probably the matrix is the

374
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,500
same.

375
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,000
Here the eigenvector changes,
so the eigenvector -- so the

376
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
point is then the eigenvector of
B --

377
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
of B is M inverse times the
eigenvector of A.

378
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay.

379
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
That's all that this says here.

380
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The eigenvector of A was X,
and so the M inverse -- similar

381
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
matrixes, then have the same
eigenvalues and their

382
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
eigenvectors are just moved
around.

383
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Of course,
that's what we -- that's what

384
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
happened way back -- and the
most important similar matrixes

385
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
are to diagonalize.

386
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So what was the point when we
diagonalized?

387
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The eigenvalues stayed the
same, of course.

388
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Three and one.

389
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,730
What about the eigenvectors?

390
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:29,000
The eigenvectors were whatever
they were for the matrix A,

391
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
but then what were the
eigenvectors for the diagonal

392
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,390
matrix?

393
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:38,580
They're just -- what are the
eigenvectors of a diagonal

394
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,000
matrix?

395
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
They're just one zero and zero
one.

396
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So this step made the
eigenvectors nice,

397
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
didn't change the eigenvalues,
and every time we don't change

398
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
the
eigenvalues.

399
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Same eigenvalues.

400
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Okay.
Now -- so I've got all these
matrixes in -- I've got this

401
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
family of matrixes with
eigenvalues three and one.

402
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Fine.

403
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
That's a nice family.

404
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's nice because those two
eigenvalues are different.

405
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I now have to --
to get into that -- the -- into

406
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
the less happy possibility that
the two eigenvalues could be the

407
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,000
same.
And then it's a little
trickier, because you remember

408
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
when two eigenvalues are the
same, what's the bad

409
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
possibility?

410
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,160
That there might not be enough
-- a full set of eigenvectors

411
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,000
and we
might not be able to

412
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
diagonalize.

413
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So I need to discuss the bad
case.

414
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So the bad -- can I just say
bad?

415
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
If lambda one equals lambda
two, then the matrix might not

416
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
be diagonalizable.

417
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Suppose lambda one equals
lambda two equals four,

418
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,000
say.
Now if I look at the family of
matrixes with eigenvalues four

419
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:27,000
and four, well,
one possibility occurs to me.

420
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:35,000
One family with eigenvalues
four and four has this matrix in

421
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
it, four times the identity.

422
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Then another -- but now I want
to ask also about the matrix

423
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
four four one zero.

424
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And my point --
here's the whole point of this

425
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,110
-- of this bad stuff,
is that this guy is not in the

426
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,000
same family with that one.

427
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
The family of a -- of matrixes
that have eigenvalues four and

428
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
four is two families.

429
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
There's this total loner here
who's in a family off -- right?

430
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Just by himself.

431
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And all the others are in with
this guy.

432
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So the big family includes this
one.

433
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And it includes a whole lot of
other matrixes,

434
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
all -- in fact,
in this two by two case,

435
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
it -- you see where -- what do
I mean -- so what I using,

436
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
this word family -- in a
family, I mean

437
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,520
they're similar.

438
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,990
So my point is that the only
matrix that's similar to this is

439
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:57,000
itself.

440
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The only matrix that's similar
to four times the identity is

441
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
four times the identity.

442
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It's off by itself.

443
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Why is that?

444
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The -- if this is my matrix,
four times the identity,

445
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
and I take
it, I multiply on the right by

446
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
any matrix M,
I multiply on the left by M

447
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
inverse, what do I get?

448
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
This is any M,
but what's the result?

449
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Well, factoring out a four,
that's just the identity matrix

450
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
in there.

451
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So then the M inverse cancels
the M, so I've just got this

452
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,710
matrix back
again.

453
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:45,000
So whatever the M is,
I'm not getting any more

454
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
members of the family.

455
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So this is one small family,
because it only has one person.

456
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
One matrix, excuse me.

457
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I think of these matrixes as
people by this point,

458
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
in eighteen oh six.

459
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Okay, the other family includes
all the rest --

460
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
all other matrixes that have
eigenvalues four and four.

461
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
This is somehow the best one in
that family.

462
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
See, I can't make it diagonal.

463
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,480
If I -- if it's diagonal,
it's this one.

464
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,000
It's in its own,
by itself.

465
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,810
So I have to think,
okay, what's the nearest I can

466
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,000
get
to diagonal?

467
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
But it will not be
diagonalizable.

468
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
That -- do you know that that
matrix is not diagonalizable?

469
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Of course, because if it was
diagonalizable,

470
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
it would be similar to that,
which it isn't.

471
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
The eigenvalues of this are
four

472
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,060
and four, but what's the catch
with that matrix?

473
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,000
It's only got one eigenvector.

474
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
That's a non-diagonalizable
matrix.

475
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Only one eigenvector.

476
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And somehow,
if I made that one into a ten

477
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
or to a million,
I could find an M,

478
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
it's in the family,
it's similar.

479
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But the best --
so the best guy in this family

480
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
is this one.

481
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And this is called the Jordan
-- so this guy Jordan picked out

482
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
-- so he, like,
studied, these families of

483
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
matrixes, and each family,
he picked out the nicest,

484
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
most diagonal one.

485
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But not completely diagonal,
because there's nobody -- there

486
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
isn't a diagonal matrix in this
family, so there's a one up

487
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
there in the Jordan form.

488
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Okay.
I think we've got to see some
more matrixes in that family.

489
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,000
So, all right,
let me -- let's just think of

490
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
some other matrixes whose
eigenvalues are four and four

491
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
but they're not
four times the identity.

492
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So -- and I believe that --
that this -- that all the

493
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
examples we pick up will be
similar to each other and -- do

494
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
you see why -- in this topic of
similar matrixes,

495
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
the climax is the Jordan form.

496
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So it says that every
matrix -- I'll write down what

497
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
the Jordan form -- what Jordan
discovered.

498
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
He found the best looking
matrix in each family.

499
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,680
And that's -- then we've got --
then we've covered all matrixes

500
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,000
including the non-diagonalizable
one.

501
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
That -- that's the point,
that in some way,

502
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Jordan completed the
diagonalization by coming as

503
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
near as he could,
which is his Jordan form.

504
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,980
And therefore,
if you want to cover all

505
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,000
matrixes, you've got to get him
in the picture.

506
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It used to be -- when I took
eighteen oh six,

507
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
that was the climax of the
course, this Jordan form stuff.

508
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I think it's not the climax of
linear algebra anymore,

509
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
because -- it's not easy to
find this Jordan form for a

510
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,060
general matrix,
because it depends on these

511
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,000
eigenvalues being exactly the
same.

512
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
You'd have to know exactly the
eigenvalues and it -- and you'd

513
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
have to know exactly the rank
and the slightest change in

514
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
numbers will change those
eigenvalues, change the rank and

515
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
therefore the whole thing is
numerically not an -- a good

516
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
thing.

517
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But for algebra,
it's the right thing to

518
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,740
understand this family.

519
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:02,000
So just tell me another matrix
-- a few more matrixes -- so

520
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
more members of the family.

521
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Let me put down again what the
best one is.

522
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Okay.
All right.

523
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Some more matrixes.

524
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Let's see, what I looking for?

525
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I'm looking for matrixes whose
trace is what?

526
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
So if I'm looking for more
matrixes in the family,

527
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
they'll all have the same
eigenvalues, four and four.

528
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So their trace will be eight.

529
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So why don't I just take,
like, five and three -- I've

530
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
got the trace right,
now the determinant

531
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
should be what?

532
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,170
Sixteen.

533
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:45,000
So I just fix this up -- shall
I put maybe a one and a minus

534
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
one there?

535
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay.
There's a matrix with
eigenvalues four and four,

536
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
because the trace is eight and
the determinant is sixteen.

537
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And I don't think it's
diagonalizable.

538
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Do you know why it's not
diagonalizable?

539
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,420
Because if it was
diagonalizable,

540
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,000
the diagonal form would have to
be this.

541
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But I can't get to that form,
because whatever I do with any

542
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
M inverse and M I stay with that
form.

543
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I could never get -- connect
those.

544
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
So I can put down more members
--

545
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,560
here -- here's another easy
one.

546
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,640
I could put the four and the
four and a seventeen down there.

547
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,000
All these matrixes are similar.

548
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,760
If I'm -- I could find an M
that would show that that one is

549
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,120
similar to that one.

550
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,000
And in -- you can see the
general picture is I can take

551
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
any a and any 8-a
here and any -- oh,

552
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,120
I don't know,
whatever you put it'd be --

553
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,000
anyway, you can see.

554
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I can fill this in,
fill this in to make the trace

555
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
equal eight, the determinant
equal 16, I get all that family

556
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
of matrixes and they're all
similar.

557
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So we see what eigenvalues do.

558
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
They're all similar and they
all have only one eigenvector.

559
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So I -- if I'm -- if you were
going to -- allow me to add to

560
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
this picture,
they have the same lambdas and

561
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
they also have the same number
of independent eigenvectors.

562
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Because if I get an eigenvector
for x I get one for --

563
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
for A, I get one for B also.

564
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So -- and same number of
eigenvectors.

565
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
But even more than that -- even
more than that -- I mean,

566
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
it's not enough just to count
eigenvectors.

567
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Yes, let me give you an example
why it's not even enough to

568
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
count eigenvectors.

569
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
So another example.

570
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So here are some matrixes --
oh, let me make them four by

571
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
four -- okay,
here -- here's a matrix.

572
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,110
I mean, like if you want
nightmares, think about matrixes

573
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,000
like these.

574
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Uh, so a one off the diagonal
-- say a one there,

575
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
how many -- what are the
eigenvalues of that matrix?

576
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,540
Oh, I mean --
okay.

577
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:34,000
What are the eigenvalues of
that matrix?

578
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Please.

579
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Four 0s, right?

580
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So we're really getting bad
matrixes now.

581
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So I mean, this is,
like -- Jordan was a good guy,

582
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:54,000
but he had to think about
matrixes that all --

583
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
that had, like -- an eigenvalue
repeated four times.

584
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
How many eigenvectors does that
matrix have?

585
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,920
Well, I'm -- eigenvectors will
be -- since the eigenvalue is

586
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,000
zero, eigenvectors will be in
the null space,

587
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,190
right?

588
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm -- eigenvectors have got to
be

589
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
A x equal zero x.

590
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
So what's the dimension of the
null space?

591
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,270
Two.

592
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,000
Somebody said two.

593
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And that's right.

594
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,220
How -- why?

595
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,000
Because you ask what's the rank
of that matrix,

596
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
the rank is obviously two.

597
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
The number of independent rows
is

598
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
two, the number of independent
columns is two,

599
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
the rank is two so the null --
the dimension of the null space

600
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
is four minus two,
so it's got two eigenvectors.

601
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,400
Two eigenvectors.

602
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,000
Two independent eigenvectors.

603
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
All right.

604
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
The dimension of the null space
is two.

605
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Now, suppose I change this zero
to a seven.

606
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
The eigenvalues are all still
zero, how -- what about -- how

607
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
many eigenvectors?

608
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
What's the dimension of the --
what's the rank of this matrix

609
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
now?

610
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Still two, right?

611
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
So it's okay.

612
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And actually,
this would be similar to the

613
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
one
that had a zero in there.

614
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But it's not as beautiful,
Jordan picked this one.

615
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
He picked -- he put ones -- we
have a one on the -- above the

616
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
diagonal for every missing
eigenvector, and here we're

617
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,840
missing two because we've got
two,

618
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,000
so we've got two eigenvectors
and two are missing,

619
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
because it's a four by four
matrix.

620
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Okay, now -- but I was going to
give you this second example.

621
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,150
0 1 0 0, let me just move the
one.

622
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,000
Oop, not there.

623
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Off the diagonal and zero zero
zero

624
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
zero zero.

625
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Okay.

626
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So now tell me about this
matrix.

627
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,180
Its eigenvalues are four zeroes
again.

628
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,000
Its rank is two again.

629
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So it has two eigenvectors and
two missing.

630
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
But the darn thing is not
similar to that one.

631
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,000
A -- a count of eigenvectors
looks like these could be

632
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
similar,
but they're not.

633
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Jordan -- see,
this is like -- a little three

634
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
by three block and a little one
by one block.

635
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And this one is like a two by
two block and a two by two

636
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
block, and those blocks are
called Jordan blocks.

637
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So let me say what is a Jordan
block?

638
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:16,000
J block number I has -- so a
Jordan block has a repeated

639
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,000
eigenvalue, lambda I,
lambda I on the diagonal.

640
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Zeroes below and ones above.

641
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So there's a block with this
guy repeated,

642
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
but it only has one
eigenvector.

643
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,000
So a Jordan block has one
eigenvector only.

644
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,130
This one has one eigenvector,
this block has one eigenvector

645
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,000
and we get two.

646
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,570
This block has one eigenvector
and that block has one

647
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,000
eigenvector and we get two.

648
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,010
So -- but the blocks are
different sizes.

649
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:10,000
And that -- it turns out Jordan
worked out -- then this is not

650
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
similar, not
similar to this one.

651
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So the -- so I'm,
like, giving you the whole

652
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
story -- well,
not the whole story,

653
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:35,000
but the main themes of the
story -- is here's Jordan's

654
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
theorem.

655
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Every square matrix A is
similar to A Jordan matrix J.

656
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And what's a Jordan matrix J?

657
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It's a matrix with these
blocks,

658
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
block -- Jordan block number
one, Jordan block number two and

659
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
so on.

660
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And let's say Jordan block
number d.

661
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And those Jordan blocks look
like that, so the eigenvalues

662
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
are sitting on the diagonal,
but we've got some of these

663
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
ones above the diagonal.

664
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:29,000
We've got the number of -- so
the number of blocks -- the

665
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,630
number of blocks is the number
of eigenvectors,

666
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:39,000
because we get one eigenvector
per block.

667
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So what I'm -- so if I
summarize Jordan's idea -- start

668
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
with any A.

669
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,000
If its eigenvalues are
distinct, then what's it similar

670
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,000
to?
This is the good case.
if I start with a matrix A and

671
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
it has different eigenvalues --
it's n eigenvalues,

672
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
none of them are repeated,
then that's a diagonal --

673
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
diagonalizable matrix -- the
Jordan blocks is -- has -- the

674
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Jordan matrix is diagonal.

675
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
It's lambda.

676
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So the good case --
the good case,

677
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,940
J is lambda.

678
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,000
All -- there are -- d=n.

679
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
There are n eigenvectors,
n blocks, diagonal,

680
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
everything great.

681
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
But Jordan covered all cases by
including these cases of

682
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
repeated eigenvalues and missing
eigenvectors.

683
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Okay.

684
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That's a description of Jordan.

685
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That --
that's -- I haven't told you

686
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
how to compute this thing,
and it isn't easy.

687
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Whereas the good case is the --
the good case is what 18.06 is

688
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,000
about.
The -- this case is what 18.06
was about 20 years ago.

689
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
So you can see you probably
won't have on the final exam the

690
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
computation of a Jordan matrix
for some horrible thing with

691
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
four repeated eigenvalues.

692
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I'm not that crazy about the
Jordan form.

693
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
But I'm very positive about
positive definite matrixes and

694
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
about the idea that's coming
Monday, the singular value

695
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
decomposition.

696
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So I'll see you on Monday,
and have a great weekend.

697
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Bye.
