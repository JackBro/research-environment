1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
OK, here is lecture ten in
linear algebra.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Two important things to do in
this lecture.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
One is to correct an error from
lecture nine.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So the blackboard with that
awful error is still with us.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,150
And the second,
the big thing to do is to tell

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,000
you about the four subspaces
that come with a matrix.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We've seen two subspaces,
the column space and the null

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
space.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,390
There's two to go.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:39,000
OK.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
First of all,
and this is a great way to

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,900
recap and correct the previous
lecture -- so you remember I was

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,000
just doing R^3.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I couldn't have taken a simpler
example than R^3.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And I wrote down the standard
basis.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's the standard basis.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The basis -- the obvious basis
for the whole three dimensional

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
space.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And then I wanted to make the
point that there was nothing

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
special, nothing about that
basis that another basis

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
couldn't have.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It could have linear
independence,

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,300
it could span a space.

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,000
There's lots of other bases.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So I started with these
vectors, one one two and two two

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
five, and those were
independent.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And then I said three three
seven wouldn't do,

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
because three three seven is
the sum of those.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So in my innocence,
I put in three three eight.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I figured probably if three
three seven is on the plane,

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
is -- which I know,
it's in the plane with these

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
two, then probably three three
eight sticks a little bit out of

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the plane and it's independent
and it gives a basis.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But after class,
to my sorrow,

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
a student tells me,
"Wait a minute,

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
that ba- that third vector,
three three eight,

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,620
is not independent." And why
did she say that?

38
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,000
She didn't actually take the
time, didn't have to,

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,240
to find w- w- what combination
of this one and this one gives

40
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,000
three three eight.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
She did something else.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In other words,
she looked ahead,

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
because she said,
wait a minute,

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
if I look at that matrix,
it's not invertible.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That third column can't be
independent of the first two,

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
because when I look at that
matrix, it's got two identical

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
rows.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I have a square matrix.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Its rows are obviously
dependent.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And that makes the columns
dependent.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So there's my error.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
When I look at the matrix A
that has those three columns,

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
those three columns can't be
independent because that matrix

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
is not invertible because it's
got two equal rows.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And today's lecture will reach
the conclusion,

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
the great conclusion,
that connects the column space

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
with the row space.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So those are -- the row space
is now going to be another one

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
of my fundamental subspaces.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The row space of this matrix,
or of this one -- well,

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
the row space of this one is
OK, but the row space of this

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
one, I'm looking at the rows of
the matrix -- oh,

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
anyway, I'll have two equal
rows and the row space will be

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
only two dimensional.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The rank of the matrix with
these columns will only be two.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So only two of those columns,
columns can be independent too.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,390
The rows tell me something
about the columns,

68
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,000
in other words,
something that I should have

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
noticed and I didn't.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
OK.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So now let me pin down these
four fundamental subspaces.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So here are the four
fundamental subspaces.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This is really the heart of
this approach to linear algebra,

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
to see these four subspaces,
how they're related.

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So what are they?

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The column space,
C of A.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The null space,
N of A.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And now comes the row space,
something new.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The row space,
what's in that?

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's all combinations of the
rows.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's natural.

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We want a space,
so we have to take all

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
combinations,
and we start with the rows.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So the rows span the row space.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Are the rows a basis for the
row space?

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Maybe so, maybe no.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,790
The rows are a basis for the
row space when they're

88
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:35,000
independent, but if they're
dependent, as in this example,

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
my error from last time,
they're not -- those three rows

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,690
are not a basis.

91
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:47,000
The row space wouldn't -- would
only be two dimensional.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I only need two rows for a
basis.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So the row space,
now what's in it?

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's all combinations of the
rows of A.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
All combinations of the rows of
A.

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But I don't like working with
row vectors.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
All my vectors have been column
vectors.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,370
I'd like to stay with column
vectors.

99
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,000
How can I get to column vectors
out of these rows?

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I transpose the matrix.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So if that's OK with you,
I'm going to transpose the

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
matrix.
I'm, I'm going to say all
combinations of the columns of A

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,930
transpose.

104
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:33,000
And that allows me to use the
convenient notation,

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
the column space of A
transpose.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,480
Nothing, no mathematics went on
there.

107
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:49,000
We just got some vectors that
were lying down to stand up.

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,490
But it means that we can use
this column space of A

109
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:04,000
transpose, that's telling me in
a nice matrix notation what the

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
row space is.

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
OK.
And finally is another null
space.

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,510
The fourth fundamental space
will be the null space of A

113
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,000
transpose.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The fourth guy is the null
space of A transpose.

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And of course my notation is N
of A transpose.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's the null space of A
transpose.

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Eh, we don't have a perfect
name for this space as a --

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,950
connecting with A,
but our usual name is the left

119
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:58,000
null space, and I'll show you
why in a moment.

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So often I call this the --
just to write that word -- the

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
left null space of A.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So just the way we have the row
space of A and we switch it to

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
the column space of A transpose,
so we have this space of guys

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
l- that I call the left null
space of A, but the good

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
notation is it's the null space
of A transpose.

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
OK.
Those are four spaces.

127
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Where are those spaces?

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What, what big space are they
in for -- when A is m by n?

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In that case,
the null space of A,

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,240
what's in the null space of A?

131
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,000
Vectors with n components,
solutions to A x equals zero.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So the null space of A is in
R^n.

133
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What's in the column space of
A?

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Well, columns.

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
How many components dothose
columns have?

136
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
m.
So this column space is in R^m.

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What about the column space of
A transpose, which are just a

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
disguised way of saying the rows
of A?

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The rows of A,
in this three by six matrix,

140
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
have six components,
n components.

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,450
The column space is in R^n.

142
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,000
And the null space of A
transpose, I see that this

143
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
fourth space is already getting
second, you know,

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
second class citizen treatment
and it doesn't deserve it.

145
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's, it should be there,
it is there,

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and shouldn't be squeezed.

147
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The null space of A transpose
--

148
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
well, if the null space of A
had vectors with n components,

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
the null space of A transpose
will be in R^m.

150
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,720
I want to draw a picture of the
four spaces.

151
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,000
OK.

152
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
OK.
Here are the four spaces.

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:37,000
OK, Let me put n dimensional
space over on this side.

154
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Then which were the subspaces
in R^n?

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The null space was and the row
space was.

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So here we have the -- can I
make that picture of the row

157
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,110
space?

158
00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:00,000
And can I make this kind of
picture of the null space?

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
That's just meant to be a
sketch, to remind you that

160
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
they're in this --
which you know,

161
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
how -- what type of vectors are
in it?

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Vectors with n components.

163
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Over here, inside,
consisting of vectors with m

164
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,800
components, is the column space
and what I'm calling the null

165
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,000
space of A transpose.

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,920
Those are the ones with m
components.

167
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,180
OK.

168
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,000
To understand these spaces is
our, is our job now.

169
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Because by understanding those
spaces, we know everything about

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
this half of linear algebra.

171
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What do I mean by understanding
those spaces?

172
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I would like to know a basis
for those spaces.

173
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
For each one of those spaces,
how would I create -- construct

174
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
a basis?

175
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What systematic way would
produce a basis?

176
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And what's their dimension?

177
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,000
OK.
So for each of the four spaces,
I have to answer those

178
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
questions.

179
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
How do I produce a basis?

180
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And then -- which has a
somewhat long answer.

181
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And what's the dimension,
which is just a number,

182
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
so it has a real short answer.

183
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Can I give you the short answer
first?

184
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I shouldn't do it,
but here it is.

185
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I can tell you the dimension of
the column space.

186
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Let me start with this guy.

187
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What's its dimension?

188
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,410
I have an m by n matrix.

189
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:08,000
The dimension of the column
space is the rank,

190
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,000
r.
We actually got to that at the
end of the last lecture,

191
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
but only for an example.

192
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So I really have to say,
OK, what's going on there.

193
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I should produce a basis and
then I just look to see how many

194
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
vectors I needed in that basis,
and the answer will be r.

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Actually, I'll do that,
before I get on to the others.

196
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What's a basis for the columns
space?

197
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,820
We've done all the work of row
reduction, identifying the pivot

198
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,280
columns, the ones that have
pivots, the ones that end up

199
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,000
with pivots.

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But now I -- the pivot columns
I'm interested in are columns of

201
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
A, the original A.

202
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,120
And those pivot columns,
there are r of them.

203
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,000
The rank r counts those.

204
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Those are a basis.

205
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So if I answer this question
for the column space,

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
the answer will be a basis is
the pivot columns and the

207
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
dimension is the rank r,
and there are r pivot columns

208
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and everything great.

209
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,330
OK.

210
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,000
So that space we pretty well
understand.

211
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I probably have a little going
back to see that -- to prove

212
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
that this is a right answer,
but you know it's the right

213
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
answer.

214
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,910
Now let me look at the row
space.

215
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,000
OK.

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Shall I tell you the dimension
of the row space?

217
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes.
Before we do even an example,
let me tell you the dimension

218
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
of the row space.

219
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,940
Its dimension is also r.

220
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,000
The row space and the column
space have the same dimension.

221
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's a wonderful fact.

222
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The dimension of the column
space of A transpose --

223
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
that's the row space -- is r.

224
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That, that space is r
dimensional.

225
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Snd so is this one.

226
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
OK.

227
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That's the sort of insight that
got used in this example.

228
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
If those --
are the three columns of a

229
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
matrix -- let me make them the
three columns of a matrix by

230
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
just erasing some brackets.

231
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
OK, those are the three columns
of a matrix.

232
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The rank of that matrix,
if I look at the columns,

233
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
it wasn't obvious to me anyway.

234
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But if I look at the rows,
now it's obvious.

235
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The row space of that matrix
obviously is two dimensional,

236
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
because I see a basis for the
row space, this row and that

237
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
row.

238
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And of course,
strictly speaking,

239
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm supposed to transpose those
guys, make them stand up.

240
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,240
But the rank is two,
and therefore the column space

241
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,000
is two dimensional by this
wonderful fact that the row

242
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
space and column space have the
same dimension.

243
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And therefore there are only
two pivot columns,

244
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
not three, and,
those, the three columns are

245
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
dependent.

246
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
OK.

247
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Now let me bury that error and
talk about the row space.

248
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Well, I'm going to give you the
dimensions of all the spaces.

249
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Because that's such a nice
answer.

250
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,000
OK.
So let me come back here.

251
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So we have this great fact to
establish, that the row space,

252
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,010
its dimension is also the rank.

253
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,000
OK.

254
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,589
What about the null space?

255
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:08,000
What's a basis for the null
space?

256
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What's the dimension of the
null space?

257
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Let me, I'll put that answer up
here for the null space.

258
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Well, how have we constructed
the null space?

259
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
We took the matrix A,
we did those row operations to

260
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
get it into a form U or,
or even further.

261
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
We got it into the reduced form
R.

262
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And then we read off special
solutions.

263
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Special solutions.

264
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And every special solution came
from a free variable.

265
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And those special solutions are
in the null space,

266
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and the great thing is they're
a basis for it.

267
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So for the null space,
a basis will be the special

268
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
solutions.

269
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And there's one for every free
variable, right?

270
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
For each free variable,
we give that variable the value

271
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,660
one, the other free variables
zero.

272
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,000
We get the pivot variables,
we get a vector in the -- we

273
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
get a special solution.

274
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So we get altogether n-r of
them, because that's the number

275
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
of free variables.

276
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
If we have r -- this is the
dimension is r,

277
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
is the number of pivot
variables.

278
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is the number of free
variables.

279
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So the beauty is that those
special solutions do form a

280
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
basis and tell us immediately
that the dimension of the null

281
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
space is n --
I better write this well,

282
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
because it's so nice -- n-r.

283
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And do you see the nice thing?

284
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That the two dimensions in this
n dimensional space,

285
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
one subspace is r dimensional
-- to be proved,

286
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,400
that's the row space.

287
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,000
The other subspace is n-r
dimensional, that's the null

288
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
space.

289
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And the two dimensions like
together give n.

290
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,440
The sum of r and n-R is n.

291
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,000
And that's just great.

292
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's really copying the fact
that we have n variables,

293
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
r of them are pivot variables
and n-r are free variables,

294
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and n altogether.

295
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,000
OK.
And now what's the dimension of
this poor misbegotten fourth

296
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
subspace?

297
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's got to be m-r.

298
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The dimension of this left null
space, left out practically,

299
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
is m-r.

300
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Well, that's really just saying
that this -- again,

301
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,300
the sum of that plus that is m,
and m is correct,

302
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,000
it's the number of columns in A
transpose.

303
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
A transpose is just as good a
matrix as A.

304
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It just happens to be n by m.

305
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It happens to have m columns,
so it will have m variables

306
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
when I go to A x equals 0 and m
of them, and r of them will be

307
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
pivot variables and m-r will be
free variables.

308
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
A transpose is as good a matrix
as A.

309
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It follows the same rule that
the this plus the dimension --

310
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,000
this dimension plus this
dimension adds up to the number

311
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
of columns.

312
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And over here,
A transpose has m columns.

313
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,000
OK.
OK.
So I gave you the easy answer,
the dimensions.

314
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Now can I go back to check on a
basis?

315
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
We would like to think that --
say the row space,

316
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
because we've got a basis for
the column space.

317
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The pivot columns give a basis
for the column space.

318
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Now I'm asking you to look at
the row space.

319
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And I -- you could say,
OK, I can produce a basis for

320
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,510
the row space by transposing my
matrix, making those columns,

321
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,000
then doing elimination,
row reduction,

322
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and checking out the pivot
columns in this transposed

323
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
matrix.

324
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But that means you had to do
all that row reduction on A

325
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
transpose.

326
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,690
It ought to be possible,
if we take a matrix A -- let me

327
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:12,000
take the matrix -- maybe we had
this matrix in the last lecture.

328
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
1 1 1, 2 1 2,
3 2 3, 1 1 1.

329
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,000
OK.
That, that matrix was so easy.

330
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
We spotted its pivot columns,
one and two,

331
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
without actually doing row
reduction.

332
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But now let's do the job
properly.

333
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So I subtract this away from
this to produce a zero.

334
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So one 2 3 1 is fine.

335
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,720
Subtracting that away leaves me
minus 1 -1 0,

336
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,000
right?

337
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And subtracting that from the
last row, oh,

338
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
well that's easy.

339
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,260
OK?

340
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm doing row reduction.

341
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,320
Now I've -- the first column is
all set.

342
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,000
The second column I now see the
pivot.

343
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And I can clean up,
if I -- actually,

344
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,000
OK.
Why don't I make the pivot into
a 1.

345
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'll multiply that row through
by by -1, and then I have 1 1.

346
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That was an elementary
operation I'm allowed,

347
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
multiply a row by a number.

348
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And now I'll do elimination.

349
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Two of those away from that
will knock this guy out and make

350
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
this into a 1.

351
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So that's now a 0 and that's a

352
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000


353
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,000
OK.
Done.

354
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
That's R.

355
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm seeing the identity matrix
here.

356
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm seeing zeros below.

357
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And I'm seeing F there.

358
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
OK.

359
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
What about its row space?

360
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
What happened to its row space
-- well, what happened -- let me

361
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
first ask, just because this is,
is -- sometimes something does

362
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
happen.

363
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Its column space changed.

364
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
The column space of R is not
the column space of A,

365
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
right?

366
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Because 1 1 1 is certainly in
the column space of A and

367
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
certainly not in the column
space of R.

368
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I did row operations.

369
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Those row operations preserve
the row space.

370
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So the row, so the column
spaces are different.

371
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Different column spaces,
different column spaces.

372
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But I believe that they have
the same row space.

373
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Same row space.

374
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I believe that the row space of
that matrix and the row space of

375
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
this matrix are identical.

376
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
They have exactly the same
vectors in them.

377
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Those vectors are vectors with
four components,

378
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
right?

379
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
They're all combinations of
those rows.

380
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,990
Or I believe you get the same
thing by taking all combinations

381
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,000
of these rows.

382
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And if true,
what's a basis?

383
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
What's a basis for the row
space of R, and it'll be a basis

384
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
for the row space of the
original A, but it's obviously a

385
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
basis for the row space of R.

386
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:48,000
What's a basis for the row
space of that matrix?

387
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,130
The first two rows.

388
00:25:52,130 --> 00:26:05,000
So a basis for the row -- so a
basis is, for the row space of A

389
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
or of R, is, is the first R rows
of R.

390
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Not of A.

391
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Sometimes it's true for A,
but not necessarily.

392
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But R, we definitely have a
matrix here whose row space we

393
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
can, we can identify.

394
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
The row space is spanned by the
three rows, but if we want a

395
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
basis we want independence.

396
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So out goes row three.

397
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
The row space is also spanned
by the first two rows.

398
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
This guy didn't contribute
anything.

399
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And of course over here this 1
2 3 1 in the bottom didn't

400
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
contribute anything.

401
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We had it already.

402
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So this, here is a basis.
1 0 1 1 and 0 1 1 0.

403
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I believe those are in the row
space.

404
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I know they're independent.

405
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Why are they in the row space?

406
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Why are those two vectors in
the row space?

407
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Because all those operations we
did, which started with these

408
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
rows and took combinations of
them --

409
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,230
I took this row minus this row,
that gave me something that's

410
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,000
still in the row space.

411
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
That's the point.

412
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
When I took a row minus a
multiple of another row,

413
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm staying in the row space.

414
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The row space is not changing.

415
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
My little basis for it is
changing, and I've ended up

416
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
with, sort of the best basis.

417
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,930
If the columns of the identity
matrix are the best basis for

418
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:57,000
R^3 or R^n, the rows of this
matrix are the best basis for

419
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,960
the row space.

420
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,000
Best in the sense of being as
clean as I can make it.

421
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Starting off with the identity
and then finishing up with

422
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
whatever has to be in there.

423
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
OK.

424
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Do you see then that the
dimension is r?

425
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
For sure, because we've got r
pivots, r non-zero rows.

426
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
We've got the right number of
vectors, r.

427
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,270
They're in the row space,
they're independent.

428
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,000
That's it.

429
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
They are a basis for the row
space.

430
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And we can even pin that down
further.

431
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
How do I know that every row of
A is a combination?

432
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,250
How do I know they span the row
space?

433
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,000
Well, somebody says,
I've got the right number of

434
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
them, so they must.

435
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
But -- and that's true.

436
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
But let me just say,
how do I know that this row is

437
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
a combination of these?

438
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
By just reversing the steps of
row reduction.

439
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
If I just reverse the steps and
go from A -- from R back to A,

440
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
then what do I,
what I doing?

441
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm starting with these rows,
I'm taking combinations of

442
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
them.

443
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
After a couple of steps,
undoing the subtractions that I

444
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,890
did before, I'm back to these
rows.

445
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,000
So these rows are combinations
of those rows.

446
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Those rows are combinations of
those rows.

447
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
The two row spaces are the
same.

448
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The bases are the same.

449
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And the natural basis is this
guy.

450
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Is that all right for the row
space?

451
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
The row space is sitting there
in R in its cleanest possible

452
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
form.

453
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,000
OK.
Now what about the fourth guy,
the null space of A transpose?

454
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
First of all,
why do I call that the left

455
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
null space?

456
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,750
So let me save that and bring
that down.

457
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,000
OK.

458
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So the fourth space is the null
space of A transpose.

459
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
So it has in it vectors,
let me call them y,

460
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
so that A transpose y equals 0.

461
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:33,000
If A transpose y equals 0,
then y is in the null space of

462
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
A transpose, of course.

463
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
So this is a matrix times a
column equaling zero.

464
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And now, because I want y to
sit on the left and I want A

465
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
instead of A transpose,
I'll just transpose that

466
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
equation.

467
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Can I just transpose that?

468
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
On the right,
it makes the zero vector lie

469
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
down.

470
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And on the left,
it's a product,

471
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
A, A transpose times y.

472
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,620
If I take the transpose,
then they come in opposite

473
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,000
order, right?

474
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So that's y transpose times A
transpose transpose.

475
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
But nobody's going to leave it
like that.

476
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
That's -- A transpose transpose
is just A, of course.

477
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
When I transposed A transpose I
got back to A.

478
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Now do you see what I have now?

479
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I have a row vector,
y transpose,

480
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
multiplying A,
and multiplying from the left.

481
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
That's why I call it the left
null space.

482
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But by making it --
putting it on the left,

483
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I had to make it into a row
instead of a column vector,

484
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and so my convention is I
usually don't do that.

485
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I usually stay with A transpose
y equals 0.

486
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
OK.

487
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And you might ask,
how do we get a basis --

488
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
or I might ask,
how do we get a basis for this

489
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
fourth space,
this left null space?

490
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,000
OK.
I'll do it in the example.

491
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
As always -- not that one.

492
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,000
The left null space is not
jumping out at me here.

493
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I know which are the free
variables --

494
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
the special solutions,
but those are special solutions

495
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
to A x equals zero,
and now I'm looking at A

496
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
transpose, and I'm not seeing it
here.

497
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,540
So -- but somehow you feel that
the work that you did which

498
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:19,000
simplified A to R should have
revealed the left null space

499
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,850
too.

500
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:25,160
And it's slightly less
immediate, but it's there.

501
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,000
So from A to R,
I took some steps,

502
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
and I guess I'm interested in
what were those steps,

503
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
or what were all of them
together.

504
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I don't -- I'm not interested
in what particular ones they

505
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
were.

506
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I'm interested in what was the
whole matrix that took me from A

507
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
to R.

508
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
How would you find that?

509
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Do you remember Gauss-Jordan,
where you tack on the identity

510
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
matrix?

511
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Let's do that again.

512
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So I, I'll do it above,
here.

513
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So this is now,
this is now the idea of -- I

514
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
take the matrix A,
which is m by n.

515
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
In Gauss-Jordan,
when we saw him before --

516
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,429
A was a square invertible
matrix and we were finding its

517
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,000
inverse.

518
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Now the matrix isn't square.

519
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It's probably rectangular.

520
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
But I'll still tack on the
identity matrix,

521
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and of course since these have
length m it better be m by m.

522
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And now I'll do the reduced row
echelon form of this matrix.

523
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And what do I get?

524
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,580
The reduced row echelon form
starts with these columns,

525
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,000
starts with the first columns,
works like mad,

526
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
and produces R.

527
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Of course, still that same
size, m by n.

528
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And we did it before.

529
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And then whatever it did to get
R, something else is going to

530
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
show up here.

531
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Let me call it E,
m by m.

532
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's whatever -- do you see
that E is just going to contain

533
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
a record of what we did?

534
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
We did whatever it took to get
A to become R.

535
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And at the same time,
we were doing it to the

536
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
identity matrix.

537
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So we started with the identity
matrix, we buzzed along.

538
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So we took some -- all this row
reduction amounted to

539
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
multiplying on the left by some
matrix, some series of

540
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
elementary matrices that
altogether gave us one matrix,

541
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
and that matrix is E.

542
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So all this row reduction stuff
amounted to multiplying by E.

543
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
How do I know that?

544
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It certainly amounted to
multiply it by something.

545
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And that something took I to E,
so that something was E.

546
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So now look at the first part,
E A is R.

547
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
No big deal.

548
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,000
All I've said is that the row
reduction steps that we all know

549
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
--
well, taking A to R,

550
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
are in a, in some matrix,
and I can find out what that

551
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
matrix is by just tacking I on
and seeing what comes out.

552
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
What comes out is E.

553
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,100
Let's just review the
invertible square case.

554
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,000
What happened then?

555
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Because I was interested in it
in chapter two also.

556
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,000
When A was square and
invertible, I took A I,

557
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I did row, row elimination.

558
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And what was the R that came
out?

559
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It was I.

560
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So in chapter two,
in chapter two,

561
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
R was I.

562
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
The row the,
the reduced row echelon form of

563
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
a nice invertible square matrix
is the identity.

564
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So if R was I in that case,
then E was -- then E was A

565
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
inverse, because E A is I.

566
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Good.
That's, that was good and easy.

567
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Now what I'm saying is that
there still is an E.

568
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It's not A inverse any more,
because A is rectangular.

569
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,490
It hasn't got an inverse.

570
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:03,000
But there is still some matrix
E that connected this to this --

571
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
oh, I should have figured out in
advanced what it was.

572
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Shoot.

573
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I didn't -- I did those steps
and sort of erased as I went --

574
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and, I should have done them to
the identity too.

575
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Can I do that?

576
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Can I do that?

577
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I'll keep the identity matrix,
like I'm supposed to do,

578
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
and I'll do the same operations
on it, and see what I end up

579
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,000
with.
OK.

580
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,900
So I'm starting with the
identity --

581
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,000
which I'll write in light,
light enough,

582
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
but -- OK.

583
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
What did I do?

584
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I subtracted that row from that
one and that row from that one.

585
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
OK, I'll do that to the
identity.

586
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,700
So I subtract that first row
from row two and row three.

587
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,120
Good.

588
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,000
Then I think I multiplied --
Do you remember?

589
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I multiplied row two by minus
one.

590
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Let me just do that.

591
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Then what did I do?

592
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I subtracted two of row two
away from row one.

593
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I better do that.

594
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Subtract two of this away from
this.

595
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
That's minus one,
two of these away leaves a plus

596
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
2 and 0.

597
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I believe that's E.

598
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:33,000
The way to check is to see,
multiply that E by this A,

599
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
just to see did I do it right.

600
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So I believe E was -1 2 0,
1 -1 0, and -1 0 1.

601
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
OK.

602
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
That's my E,
that's my A,

603
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
and that's R.

604
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
All right.

605
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,250
All I'm struggling to do is
right, the reason I wanted this

606
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:08,000
blasted E was so that I could
figure out the left null space,

607
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
not only its dimension,
which I know -- actually,

608
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,000
what is the dimension of the
left null space?

609
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So here's my matrix.

610
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
What's the rank of the matrix?

611
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000


612
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And the dimension of the null
-- of the left null space is

613
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
supposed to be m-r.

614
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It's 3 -2, 1.

615
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I believe that the left null
space is one dimensional.

616
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
There is one combination of
those three rows that produces

617
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
the zero row.

618
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
There's a basis -- a basis for
the left null space has only got

619
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
one vector in it.

620
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And what is that vector?

621
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
It's here in the last row of E.

622
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,740
But we could have seen it
earlier.

623
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:02,000
What combination of those rows
gives the zero row?

624
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
-1 of that plus one of that.

625
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,780
So a basis for the left null
space of this matrix -- I'm

626
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:15,000
looking for combinations of rows
that give the zero row if I'm

627
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
looking at the left null space.

628
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
For the null space,
I'm looking at combinations of

629
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
columns to get the zero column.

630
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Now I'm looking at combinations
of these three rows to get the

631
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
zero row, and of course there is
my zero row, and here is my

632
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
vector that produced it.
-1 of that row and one of that

633
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,000
row.
Obvious.

634
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,000
OK.
So in that example --
and actually in all examples,

635
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
we have seen how to produce a
basis for the left null space.

636
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I won't ask you that all the
time, because -- it didn't come

637
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
out immediately from R.

638
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
We had to keep track of E for
that left null space.

639
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But at least it didn't require
us to transpose the matrix and

640
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
start all over again.

641
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
OK, those are the four
subspaces.

642
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Can I review them?

643
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
The row space and the null
space are in R^n.

644
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Their dimensions add to n.

645
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
The column space and the left
null space are in R^m,

646
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
and their dimensions add to m.

647
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
OK.

648
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:41,000
So let me close these last
minutes by pushing you a little

649
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,650
bit more to a new type of vector
space.

650
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:55,000
All our vector spaces,
all the ones that we took

651
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:03,000
seriously, have been subspaces
of some real three or n

652
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
dimensional space.

653
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Now I'm going to write down
another vector space,

654
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
a new vector space.

655
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:24,960
Say all three by three
matrices.

656
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,000
My matrices are the vectors.

657
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Is that all right?

658
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I'm just naming them.

659
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You can put quotes around
vectors.

660
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Every three by three matrix is
one of my vectors.

661
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Now how I entitled to call
those things vectors?

662
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I mean, they look very much
like matrices.

663
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But they are vectors in my
vector space because they obey

664
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,000
the rules.
All I'm supposed to be able to
do with vectors is add them -- I

665
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
can add matrices -- I'm supposed
to be able to multiply them by

666
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
scalar numbers like seven --
well, I can multiply a matrix by

667
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And that --
and I can take combinations of

668
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
matrices, I can take three of
one matrix minus five of another

669
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,000
matrix.
And those combinations,
there's a zero matrix,

670
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
the matrix that has all zeros
in it.

671
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
If I add that to another
matrix, it doesn't change it.

672
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
All the good stuff.

673
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
If I multiply a matrix by one
it doesn't change it.

674
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
All those eight rules for a
vector space that we never wrote

675
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
down, all easily satisfied.

676
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
So now we have a different --
now of course you can say you

677
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
can multiply those matrices.

678
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I don't care.

679
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
For the moment,
I'm only thinking of these

680
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
matrices as forming a vector
space --

681
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
so I only doing A plus B and c
times A.

682
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I'm not interested in A B for
now.

683
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:07,530
The fact that I can multiply is
not relevant to th- to a vector

684
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:08,000
space.

685
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,000
OK.
So I have three by three
matrices.

686
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And how about subspaces?

687
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:23,000
What's -- tell me a subspace of
this matrix space.

688
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Let me call this matrix space
M.

689
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That's my matrix space,
my space of all three by three

690
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
matrices.

691
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,430
Tell me a subspace of it.

692
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:35,000
OK.

693
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
What about the upper triangular
matrices?

694
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
So subspaces.

695
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Subspaces of M.

696
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
All, all upper triangular
matrices.

697
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Another subspace.

698
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
All symmetric matrices.

699
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:03,000
The intersection of two
subspaces is supposed to be a

700
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
subspace.

701
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,000
We gave a little effort to the
proof of that fact.

702
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:22,000
If I look at the matrices that
are in this subspace --

703
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
they're symmetric,
and they're also in this

704
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
subspace, they're upper
triangular, what do they look

705
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,450
like?

706
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:34,000
Well, if they're symmetric but
they have zeros below the

707
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
diagonal, they better have zeros
above the diagonal,

708
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
so the intersection would be
diagonal matrices.

709
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,380
That's another subspace,
smaller than those.

710
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,000
How can I use the word smaller?

711
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Well, I'm now entitled to use
the word smaller.

712
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I mean, well,
one way to say is,

713
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
OK, these are contained in
those.

714
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
These are contained in those.

715
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
But more precisely,
I could give the dimension of

716
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
these spaces.

717
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
So I could -- we can compute --
let's compute it next time,

718
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
the dimension of all upper --
of the subspace of upper

719
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
triangular three by three
matrices.

720
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
The dimension of symmetric
three by three matrices.

721
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,920
The dimension of diagonal three
by three matrices.

722
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,000
Well, to produce dimension,
that means I'm supposed to

723
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
produce a basis,
and then I just count how many

724
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
vecto- how many I needed in the
basis.

725
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Let me give you the answer for
this one.

726
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
What's the dimension?

727
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
The dimension of this --
say, this subspace,

728
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
let me call it D,
all diagonal matrices.

729
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:58,000
The dimension of this subspace
is -- as I write you're working

730
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
it out -- three.

731
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Because here's a matrix in this
-- it's a diagonal matrix.

732
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Here's another one.

733
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Here's another one.

734
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Better make it diagonal,
let me put a seven there.

735
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
That was not a very great
choice, but it's three diagonal

736
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
matrices, and I believe that
they're a basis.

737
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I believe that those three
matrices are independent and I

738
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
believe that any diagonal matrix
is a combination of those three.

739
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So they span the subspace of
diagonal matrices.

740
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Do you see that idea?

741
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It's like stretching the idea
from R^n to R^(n by n),

742
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,960
three by three.

743
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,000
But the -- we can still add,
we can still multiply by

744
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
numbers, and we just ignore the
fact that we can multiply two

745
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
matrices together.

746
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
OK, thank you.

747
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
That's lecture ten.
