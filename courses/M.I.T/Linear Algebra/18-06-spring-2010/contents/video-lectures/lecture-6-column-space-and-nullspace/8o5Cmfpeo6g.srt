1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,850
This is lecture six in linear
algebra, and we're at the start

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,000
of this new chapter,
chapter three in the text,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
which is really getting to the
center of linear algebra.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And I had time to make a first
start on it at the end of

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
lecture five.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But now is lecture six is
officially the lecture on vector

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,620
spaces and subspaces.

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,000
And then especially -- there
are two subspaces that we're

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,540
specially interested in.

11
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,470
One is the column space of a
matrix, the other is the null

12
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,200
space of the matrix.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,000
So, I got to tell you what
those are.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay.
So, first to remember from
lecture five,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,770
what is a vector space?

16
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:09,000
It's a bunch of vectors that --
where I'm allowed -- where I can

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
add -- I can add any two vectors
in the space and the answer

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,460
stays in the space.

19
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,000
Or I can multiply any vector in
the space by any constant and

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
the result stays in the space.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So that's -- in fact if I
combine those two into one,

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
you can see that -- if I can
add and I can multiply by

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
numbers, that really means that
I can take linear combinations.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So the quick way to say it is
that all linear combinations,

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
C --
any multiple of V plus any

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
multiple of W stay in the space.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So, can I give you examples
that are vector spaces and also

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
some examples that are not,
to make that point clear?

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So, suppose I'm in three
dimensions.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Then one way to get us one
space is the whole three

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
dimensional space.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So the whole space R^3,
three dimensional space,

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
would be a vector space,
because if I have a couple of

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
vectors I can add them and I'm
certainly okay and they follow

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
all the rules.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So R^3 is easy.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Now I'm interested also in
subspaces.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So there's this key word,
subspaces.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's a space -- that's some
vectors inside the given space,

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,660
inside R three that still make
up a vector space of their own.

41
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,000
It's a vector space inside a
vector space.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And the simplest example was a
plane.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So, like, can I just sketch it
-- there is a plane.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's got to go through the
origin, and of course it goes

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
infinitely far.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's of that's a subspace
now.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,120
Do you see that if I have two
vectors on the plane and I add

48
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,000
them, the result stays in the
plane.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If I take a vector in the plane
and I multiply by minus two,

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm still in the plane.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So that plane is a subspace.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So let me just make that point.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Plane through zero,
through that zero zero zero is

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
a subspace.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay.
And also, another subspace
would be a line.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
A line through zero zero zero
-- yeah, the line has to go

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
through the origin.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
All subspaces have got to
contain the origin,

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
contain zero -- the zero
vector.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So this line is a subspace.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Really, if I want to say it
really correctly,

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I should say a subspace of R^3.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That of R^3 was,
like, understood there.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Now -- so let me call this
plane P.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And let me call this line L.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And let me ask you about other
sets of vectors.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Suppose I took --
yeah -- so here's a first

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
question.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Suppose I take two subspaces,
like P and L.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And I just put them together,
take their union,

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
take all the vectors -- so now
you've got P and L in mind,

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
here.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So I have two subspaces.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I have two subspaces and,
for example,

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
P -- a plane and L a line.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now I want to ask you about the
union of those.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So P union L.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is all vectors in P or L
or both.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Is that a subspace?

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,810
Is this a subspace?

82
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,000
This is or is not a subspace?

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Because we're -- I just want to
be sure that I've got the

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
central idea.

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Suppose I take the vectors in
the plane and also the vectors

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
on that line,
put them together,

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
so I've got a bunch of vectors,
is it a subspace?

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Can you give me,
like, so the camera can hear it

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
or maybe the tape.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Can you say yes or no?

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Do I have a subspace if I put
-- if I take all the vectors on

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
the plane plus all -- and all
the ones on the line and just

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,050
join them together --
but I'm not taking this guy

94
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,000
that's -- actually,
I'm not taking most of them,

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
because most vectors are not on
the line or the plane,

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
they're off somewhere else.

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,650
Do I have a subspace?

98
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,000
STUDENTS: No.

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
STRANG: Right.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Thank you.

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No.
Because -- why not?

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Because I can't add.

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Because if I that requirement
isn't satisfied.

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
If I take one vector like this
guy and another vector that

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
happens to come from L and add,
I'm off somewhere else.

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You see that I've gone outside
the union if I just add

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
something from P and something
from L, then normally what'll

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
happen is I'm outside the union
-- and I don't have a subspace.

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So the correct answer is -- is
not.

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay.

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Now let me ask you about -- the
other thing we do is take the

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,240
intersection.

113
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,000
So what does intersection mean?

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Intersection means all vectors
that are in both P and L.

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Is this a subspace.

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, so I guess I want to go
back up to the same question.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This is or is not a subspace?

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And you can answer me -- answer
the question first for this

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
particular example,
this picture I drew.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What is P intersect L for this
case?

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
STUDENT: It's only zero.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
STRANG: It's only zero.

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
At least, sort of this was the
artist's idea as he drew it

124
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
that, that that line L was not
in the plane and,

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
went off somewhere else --
and then the only point that

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
was in common was the zero
vector.

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Is the zero vector by itself a
subspace?

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
STUDENT: Yes.

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,430
STRANG: Yes,
absolutely.

130
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,540
And what about,
if I don't have this plane and

131
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,000
this line but any subspace and
any other subspace?

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So now -- can I ask that
question for any two subspaces?

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,540
So maybe I'll write it up here.

134
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,000
If I'm strong enough.

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,800
Okay.

136
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,000
So this is the general
question.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,100
I have subspaces,
say S and T.

138
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:03,000
And I want to ask you about
their intersection S intersect T

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,070
and I want -- it is a subspace.

140
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,000
Do you see why?

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Do you see why if I take the
vectors that are in both one-

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
th- that are in both of the
subspaces -- so that's like a

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
smaller set of vectors,
probably, because it's --

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
we've added requirements.

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,460
It has to be in S and in T.

146
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,000
How do I know that's a
subspace?

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Can we just think through that
abstract stuff and then I get to

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
the examples.

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay.

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So why?
Suppose I take a couple of
vectors that are in the

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
intersection.

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Why is the sum also in the
intersection?

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay, so let me give a name to
these vectors,

154
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
say V and W.

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
They're in the intersection.

156
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So that means they're both in
S.

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Also means they're both in T.

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So what can I say about V plus
W?

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Is it in S?

160
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes.
Right?

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
If I take two vectors,
V and W that are both in S,

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
then the sum is in S,
because S was a subspace.

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And if they're both in T and I
add them, then the result is

164
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
also in T, because T was a
subspace.

165
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So the result V plus W is in
the intersection.

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's in both and requirement
one is satisfied.

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Requirement two's the same.

168
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If I take a vector that's in
both, I multiply by seven.

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Seven times that vector is in
S, because the vector was in S.

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Seven times that vector's in T
because the original one was in

171
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
T.
So seven times that vector is
in the intersection.

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
In other words,
when you take the intersection

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
of two subspaces,
you get probably a smaller

174
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
subspace, but it is a subspace.

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay.

176
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So that's like sort of just
emphasizing what these two

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
requirements mean.

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Again --
Let me circle those,

179
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
because those are so important.

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,500
The sum and the scale of
multiplication which combines

181
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,000
into linear combinations.

182
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's what you have to do
inside the subspace.

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay.
On to the column space.

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay.
So my lecture last time started
that and I want to continue it.

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Okay.

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Column space of a matrix.

187
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Of A.

188
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay.

189
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Can I take an example?

190
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Say one two three four.

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
One one one one.

192
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Two three four five.

193
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay.

194
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's my matrix A.

195
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So, it's got columns,
three columns.

196
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,350
Those columns are vectors,
so the column space of this A,

197
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,000
of this A -- let's stay with
this example for a while.

198
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The column space of this matrix
is a subspace of R -- R what?

199
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So what space are we in if I'm
looking at the columns of this

200
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
matrix?

201
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,820
R^4 , right?

202
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,540
These are vectors in R^4,
they're four dimensional

203
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,000
vectors.

204
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So it's this column space of A
is a subspace of R^4 here,

205
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
because A was four by -- A is a
four by three matrix.

206
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This tells me how many rows
there are, how many components

207
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
in a column, and so we're in
R^4.

208
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Okay, now what's in that
subspace?

209
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So the column space of A,
it's a subspace of R^4.

210
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I call it the column space of
A, like that.

211
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,210
So that's my little symbol for
some subspace of R^4.

212
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,000
What's in that subspace?

213
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, that column certainly is.

214
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,180
One two three four.

215
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,000
This column is in.

216
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This column is in,
and what else?

217
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So it's got the columns of A in
it, but that's not enough,

218
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,620
certainly.

219
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,000
Right?

220
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't have a subspace if I
just put in three vectors.

221
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So how do I fill that out to be
a subspace?

222
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I take their linear
combinations.

223
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So the column space of A is all
linear combinations --

224
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
combinations of the columns.

225
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And that does give me a
subspace.

226
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It does give me a vector space,
because if I have one linear

227
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
combination and I multiply by
eleven, I've got another linear

228
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
combination.

229
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If I have a linear combination,
I add to another linear

230
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,660
combination I get a third
combination.

231
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,000
So that -- this is like the
smallest space -- like,

232
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
it's got to have those three
columns in it,

233
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and it has to have their
combinations and that's where we

234
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
stop.

235
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Okay.
Now I'm going to be interested
in that space.

236
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So I, like -- get some idea of
what's in that space.

237
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
How big is that space?

238
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Is that space the whole four
dimensional space?

239
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Or is it a subspace inside?

240
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Can you -- let me just see if
we can get a yes or no answer

241
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
sometimes without being ready
for the complete proof.

242
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What do you think?

243
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Is the subspace that I'm
talking about here,

244
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
the combinations of those three
guys, does that fill the full

245
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
four dimensional space?

246
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Maybe yes or no on that one.

247
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,000
No.
No.
Somehow our feeling is,
and it happens to be right,

248
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
that if we start with three
vectors and take their

249
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
combinations,
we can't get the whole four

250
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
dimensional space.

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Now -- so somehow we get a
smaller space.

252
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But how much smaller?

253
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,620
That's going to come up here.

254
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,000
That's not so immediate.

255
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Let me first make this critical
connection with --

256
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,860
with, linear equations,
because behind our abstract

257
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,000
definition, we have a purpose.

258
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And that is to understand Ax=b.

259
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So suppose I make the
connection -- w- w- does A x=b

260
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,740
always have a solution for every
b?

261
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:37,000
Have a solution for every
right-hand side?

262
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I guess that's going to be a
yes or no question.

263
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And then I'm going to ask which
right-hand sides are okay?

264
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's really the question I'm
after, is which right-hand sides

265
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
(b) do make up -- you can see
from the way I'm speaking what

266
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
the question --
As it is.

267
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The answer is no.

268
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
A x=b does not have a solution
for every b.

269
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Why do I say no?

270
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Because A x=b is -- like,
this is four equations,

271
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and only three unknowns.

272
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Right?

273
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:44,000
X is -- let me right out that
whole -- what the whole thing

274
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
looks like.

275
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yeah.
Let me write out A x=b.

276
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
A x is -- these columns are one
two three four.

277
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
One one one one and two three
four five.

278
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Then x, of course,
has three components,

279
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
x1, x2, x3.

280
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And I'm trying to get the --
hit the right-hand side,

281
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
b1,b2,b3 and b4.

282
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So my first point is,
I can't always do it.

283
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
In a way, that just says again
what you told me five minutes

284
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
ago --
that the combinations of these

285
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
columns don't fill the whole
four dimensional space.

286
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
There's going to be some
vectors b, a lot of vectors b,

287
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
that are not combinations of
these three columns,

288
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
because the combinations of
those columns are,

289
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
like, going to be just a little
plane or something inside --

290
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
inside R^4.

291
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Now, so and you see that I do
have four equations and only

292
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
three unknowns.

293
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So, like anybody is going to
say, no you dope,

294
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
you can't usually solve four
equations with only three

295
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
unknowns.

296
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But now I want to say sometimes
you can.

297
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
For some right-hand sides,
I can solve this.

298
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So that's the bunch of
right-hand sides that I'm

299
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
interested in right now.

300
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,450
Which right-hand sides allow me
to solve this?

301
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,000
This is the question for today.

302
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's going to have,
like, a nice clear answer.

303
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So my question is -- is which
bs, which vectors b,

304
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,700
allow this system to be solved?

305
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,000
And I want to ask you -- so
that's, like,

306
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,000
gets two question marks to
indicate that's --

307
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,230
this is the important question.

308
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,000
Okay, first,
before we give a total answer,

309
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
give me just a partial answer.

310
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Tell me one right-hand side
that I know I can solve this

311
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
thing for.

312
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So -- all zeroes.

313
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Okay.
That's the, like,
guaranteed.

314
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
If these were all zero,
then I know I can solve it,

315
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,430
let the x-s all be zero,
no problem.

316
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:36,000
Okay.

317
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So that's always a -- okay.

318
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
A x=0 I can always solve.

319
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Now tell me another right-hand
side, just a specific set of

320
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
numbers for which I can solve
these three --

321
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
these four equations with only
three unknowns,

322
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
but if you give me a good
right-hand side,

323
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I can do it.

324
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So tell me one?

325
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
STUDENT:1 2 3 4.

326
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
STRANG: 1 2 3 4?

327
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
If I -- can I solve -- is that
a good right-hand side?

328
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Can you solve --
can you find a solution that --

329
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
X one plus X two plus two X
three is one,

330
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,900
two X one plus X two plus three
X three is two and two more

331
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,220
equations -- so I'm asking you
to solve in your head in --

332
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,000
within five seconds,
four equations and three

333
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
unknowns, but you can do it,
because the right-hand side is,

334
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
like, showing up here is --
it's one of the columns.

335
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So tell me what's the X that
does solve it?

336
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
One zero zero.

337
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,890
One zero zero solves it,
because -- well,

338
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:57,000
so you can multiply this out by
rows, but oh God,

339
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
it's much nicer to say --
okay, this is one of this

340
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
column, zero of this,
zero of this,

341
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
so it's one of that column,
which is exactly what we

342
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
wanted.

343
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Okay.

344
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So there is a b that's okay.

345
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Now tell me another B that's
okay, another right-hand side

346
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
that would be all right?

347
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Well -- all ones?

348
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Actually -- and then what's the
solution in that case?

349
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
0 1 0, thanks.

350
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And, in fact,
it's much e- like,

351
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
one way to do it is think of a
solution first,

352
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
right, and then just see what b
turns out to be.

353
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,340
What b turns out to be,
right.

354
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,000
Okay.

355
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So I think of a solution -- so
I think of an x,

356
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I think of any -- x1,
x2, x3, I do this

357
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
multiplication and what have I
got?

358
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Now I'm ready to answer the big
question.

359
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I can solve A x=b exactly when
the right-hand side B is a

360
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
vector in the column space.

361
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Good.
I can solve A x=b when b is a
combination of the columns,

362
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
when it's in the column space
-- so let me write that answer

363
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
down.

364
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I can solve Ax=b exactly when B
is in the column space.

365
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,670
Let me just say again why that
is.

366
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:57,330
Because it -- the column space
by its definition contains all

367
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,000
the combinations.

368
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It contains all the Ax-s.

369
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,000
The column space really
consists of all vectors A times

370
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,640
any X.

371
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,000
So those are the bs that I can
deal with.

372
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
If b is a combination of the
columns, then that combination

373
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
tells me what X should be.

374
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
If b is not a combination of
the columns, then there is no x.

375
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
There's no way to solve A x
equal b.

376
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Okay.

377
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So the column space -- that's
really why we're interested in

378
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
this column space,
because it's the central guy.

379
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It says when we can solve,
and that --

380
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
we got to understand this
column space better.

381
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Let's see.

382
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Do I want to think -- yeah,
somehow -- oh,

383
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
well, let's just -- as long as
we've got it here,

384
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
what do I get for this
particular example?

385
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,590
If I take combinations of this
and this and this,

386
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,000
I'll tell you the question
that's in my mind.

387
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's not even proper to use
this word yet,

388
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
but you'll know what it means.

389
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,410
Are those three columns
independent?

390
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:40,000
If I take the combinations of
the three columns -- does each

391
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
column contribute something new
or now?

392
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So that if I take the
combinations of those three

393
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
columns, do I,
like, get some three

394
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
dimensional subspace -- do I
have three vectors that are,

395
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
like, you know,
independent,

396
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,680
whatever that means?

397
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,000
Or do I -- is one of those
columns, like,

398
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
contributing nothing new --
So that actually only two of

399
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
the columns would have given the
same column space?

400
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,550
Yeah -- that's a good way to
ask the question.

401
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,000
Finally I think of it.

402
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Can I throw away any columns --
and have the same column space?

403
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
STUDENT: Yes.

404
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
STRANG: Yes.

405
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And which one do you suggest I
throw away?

406
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
STUDENT: Column three -- three.

407
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,710
STRANG: Well,
three is the natural,

408
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,000
like, guy to target.

409
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So if I -- and why?

410
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Because -- what's so bad about
three here?

411
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Column three?

412
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It's the sum of these,
right?

413
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So it's not -- if I'm taking --
if I have combinations of these

414
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
two and I put in this one,
actually, I don't get anything

415
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,570
more.

416
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,000
So later on I will call these
pivot columns.

417
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And the third guy will not be a
pivot column in this -- with

418
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
those numbers.

419
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Now actually -- honesty makes
me ask you this question.

420
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Could I have thrown away column
one?

421
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Yes, I could.

422
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I could.

423
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So when I say pivot columns,
my convention is,

424
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
okay, I'll keep the first ones
as long as they're not

425
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,000
dependent.
So I keep this guy,
he's fine, he's a line.

426
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I keep the second guy.

427
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It's in a second direction.

428
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But the third one,
which is in the same plane as

429
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,510
the first two gives me nothing
new.

430
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:44,000
It's dependent in the language
that we will use and I don't

431
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
need it.

432
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Okay.
So I would describe the column
space of this matrix as a two

433
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
dimensional subspace of R^4.

434
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
A two dimensional subspace of
R^4.

435
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Okay.
So you're seeing how these
vector spaces work and you --

436
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
you're seeing that we -- some
idea of dependence or

437
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
independence is in our future.

438
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Okay.

439
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Now I want to speak about
another vector space,

440
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
the null space.

441
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So again I'm getting a little
ahead because it's in section

442
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
three point two,
but that's okay.

443
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
All right.

444
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Now I'm ready for the null
space.

445
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Let me keep the same matrix.

446
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And this is going to be a
different -- totally different

447
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
subspace.

448
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Totally different.

449
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Okay.

450
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Now -- so let me make space for
it.

451
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Now --
here comes a completely

452
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
different subspace,
the null space of A.

453
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
What's in it?

454
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It contains not right-hand
sides b.

455
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
It contains x-s.

456
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It contains all x-s that solve
-- this word null is going to --

457
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I mean, that's the key word
here, meaning zero.

458
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So this contains --
this is all solutions x,

459
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
and of course x is our vectors,
x1, x2 and x3,

460
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
to the equation A x=0.

461
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Well, four equations,
because we've got -- so,

462
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
do you see what I'm doing?

463
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm now saying,
okay, columns were great,

464
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
the column space we understood.

465
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Now I'm interested in x-s.

466
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm not -- the only b I'm
interested in now is the b of

467
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
all zeroes.

468
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
The right-hand side is now
zeroes.

469
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And I'm interested in
solutions.

470
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
x-s.

471
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So t- where is this null space
for this example?

472
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
These x-s are -- have three
components.

473
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:29,580
So the null space is a subspace
-- we still have to show it is a

474
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,000
subspace -- of R^3.

475
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So this is -- and we will show
-- these vectors x,

476
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
this is in R^3,
where the column space was in

477
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
R^4 in our example.

478
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
For an m by n matrix,
this is m and this is n,

479
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
because the number of columns,
n, tells me how many unknowns,

480
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
how many x-s multiply those
columns, so it tells me the big

481
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
space, in this case R three that
I'm in.

482
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Now tell me --
why don't we figure out what

483
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
the null space is for this
example, just by looking at it.

484
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I mean, that's the beauty of
small examples,

485
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,600
that my official way to find
null spaces and column spaces

486
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,000
and get all the facts straight
would be elimination,

487
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
and we'll do that.

488
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But with a small example,
we can see that --

489
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
see what's going on without
going through the mechanics of

490
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
elimination.

491
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So this null space -- so I'm
talking about -- again,

492
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
the null space,
and let me copy again the

493
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
matrix.

494
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
One two three four,
one one one one and two three

495
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
four five.

496
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
What's in the null space?

497
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So I'm taking A times x,
so let me right it again,

498
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
and I want you to solve those
four equations.

499
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
In fact, I want you to find all
solutions to those four

500
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
equations.

501
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Well, actually,
just first of all find one.

502
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Why should I ask you for all of
them?

503
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Tell me one -- well,
tell me one solution that y-

504
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
you don't even have to look at
the matrix to know one solution

505
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
to this set of equations.

506
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It is zero vector.

507
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Whatever that matrix is,
its null space contains zero --

508
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
because A times the zero vector
sure gives the zero right-hand

509
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,000
side.
So the null space certainly
contains zero.

510
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,780
A- so it's got a chance to be a
vector space now,

511
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,000
and it will turn out it is.

512
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Okay.
Tell me another solution.

513
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So this particular null space
-- and of course I'm going to

514
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,630
call it N(A) for null space --
this contains-- well we've

515
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:19,000
already located the zero vector,
and now you're going to tell me

516
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
another vector that's in the
null space, another solution,

517
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
another x, another --
you see what I'm asking you for

518
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
is a combination of those
columns.

519
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
That's what I'm always looking
at combinations of columns,

520
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
but now I'm looking at the
weights, the coefficients in the

521
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
combination.

522
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So tell me a good set of
numbers to put in there.

523
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
One one -- STUDENTS:
Minus one.

524
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
STRANG: One one minus one.

525
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,220
Thanks.

526
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,000
One one minus one.

527
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So there's a vector that's in
it.

528
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,990
Okay.

529
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:59,000
But have I got a subspace at
this point?

530
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Certainly not,
right?

531
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I've got just a couple of
vectors.

532
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
No way they make a subspace.

533
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Tell me -- actually,
why don't I jump the whole way

534
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
now?

535
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Tell me -- well,
tell me one more solution,

536
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
one more X that would work.

537
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Student: 2 2 -2.

538
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
STRANG: 2 2 -2?

539
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh, well, tell me all of them,
that would have been easier.

540
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Tell me the whole lot,
now.

541
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
What is the null space for this
matrix?

542
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's all vectors of the form --
what could this be?

543
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It could be one one minus one,
it could be it could be any

544
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
number C, any number --
the same number again and --

545
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
STUDENTS: Minus.

546
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
STRANG: Minus C.

547
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
In other words -- actually,
any multiple of this guy.

548
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Oh, that's the perfect
description, because now the

549
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
zero vector's automatically
included because C could be

550
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
zero.

551
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The vector I had is included,
because C could be one.

552
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
But now any vector.

553
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,690
And that's actually it.

554
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,010
And do I have a subspace?

555
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,000
And what does it look like?

556
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's in -- how would you
describe this,

557
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
the null space,
this --

558
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
all these vectors of this form
C C minus C, like,

559
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
seven seven minus seven.

560
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Minus eleven minus eleven plus
eleven.

561
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
What have I got here?

562
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
If -- describe that whole null
space of -- what -- if I drew

563
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
it, what do I draw?

564
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,950
A line, right?

565
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:52,000
The null space is a line.

566
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It's the line through -- in R^3
and the vector one one negative

567
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
one maybe goes down here,
I don't know where it goes,

568
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
say, down here.

569
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
There's the vector one one
negative one that you gave me.

570
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And where is the vector C C
negative C?

571
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It's on this line.

572
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Of course, there's zero zero
zero that we had.

573
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,050
And what we've got is that
whole -- oops -- that whole

574
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:28,000
line, going both ways,
through the origin.

575
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
The null space is a line in
R^3.

576
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Okay.

577
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
For that example,
we could find all the

578
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
combinations of the columns that
gave zero at sight.

579
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Now, can I just take one more
time, to go back to the

580
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
definition of subspace,
vector space,

581
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:01,000
and ask you -- how do I know
that the null space is a vector

582
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
space?

583
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
How I entitled to use this word
space?

584
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I'll never use that word space
without meaning that the two

585
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
requirements are satisfied.

586
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Can we just check that they
are?

587
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So I'm going to check that --
can I just continue here?

588
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Check that -- that the
solutions to A x=0 always give a

589
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
subspace.

590
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And, of course,
the key word is that= "Space."

591
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So what do I have to check?

592
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I have to show that if I have
one solution,

593
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
call it x, and another
solution, call it x*,

594
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
that their sum is also a
solution, right?

595
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,440
That's a requirement.

596
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,000
To use that word space,
I have to say --

597
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I have to convince myself that
if A x is zero and also -- and A

598
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:26,000
x* is zero, or maybe I should
have said if A v is zero and A w

599
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
is zero, then what about v plus
w?

600
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Shall I -- let me use those
letters.

601
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:41,000
If A v is zero and A w is zero,
then what --

602
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
if that and that,
then what's my point here?

603
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That A times (v+w) must be
zero.

604
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
That says that if v is in the
null space and w's in the null

605
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,910
space, then their sum v+w is in
the null space.

606
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:02,000
And of course,
now that I've written it down,

607
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
it's totally absurd,
ridiculously simple --

608
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
because matrix multiplication
allows me to separate that out

609
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
into A v plus A w.

610
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I shouldn't say absurdly
simple.

611
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
That was a dumb thing to say.

612
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Could -- we've used,
here, a basic law of matrix

613
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
multiplication.

614
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Actually, we've used it without
proving it, but that's okay.

615
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
We only live so long,
we just skip that proof.

616
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,880
I think it's called the
distributive law that I can

617
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,000
split these -- split this into
two pieces.

618
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
But now you see the point,
that A v is zero and A w is

619
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
zero so I have zero plus zero
and I do get zero.

620
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
It checks.

621
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And, similarly,
I have to show that if A v is

622
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,540
zero, then A times any multiple,
say 12v is also zero.

623
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,670
And how do I know that?

624
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:11,000
Because I'm allowed to s- bring
that twelve outside.

625
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
A number, a scaler can move
outside, so I have twelve A vs,

626
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
twelve zeroes --
I have zero.

627
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Okay.

628
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Just to -- it's really critical
to understand the -- oh yeah.

629
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Here -- I was going to say,
understand what's the point of

630
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
a vector space?

631
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Let me make that point by
changing the right-hand side.

632
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Oops.

633
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Okay.
Let me change the right-hand
side to one two three four.

634
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Oh, okay.

635
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Why don't we do all of linear
algebra in one lecture,

636
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
then we -- okay.

637
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I would like to know the
solutions to this equation.

638
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
For those four equations.

639
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So I have four equations.

640
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I have only three unknowns,
so if I don't have a pretty

641
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
special right-hand side there
won't be any solution at all.

642
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
But that is a very special
right-hand side.

643
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And we know that there is a
solution, one zero zero.

644
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Were there any more solutions?

645
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And did they form a vector
space?

646
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Okay.

647
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So I'm asking two questions
there.

648
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
One is, do -- so my right-hand
side now is not zero anymore.

649
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm not looking at the null
space because I changed from

650
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
zeroes.

651
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So my first question is,
do the solutions,

652
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
if there are any and there are,
do they form a subspace?

653
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Let's answer that question
first.

654
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Yes or no.

655
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,840
Do I get a subspace if I look
at the solutions to -- let me go

656
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,000
back to x1 x2 x3.

657
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I'm looking at all the x-s,
at all those vectors in R^3

658
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,110
that solve A x -b.

659
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:18,000
The only thing I've changed is
b isn't zero anymore.

660
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Do the x-s, the solutions,
form a vector space?

661
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
The solutions to this do not
form a subspace.

662
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
The solutions don't,
because -- how shall I see

663
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
that?

664
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
The zero vector is not a
solution, so I never even got

665
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,000
started.
The zero vector doesn't solve
this system.

666
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I can't -- solutions can't be a
vector space.

667
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Now what are they like?

668
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,820
Well, we'll see this,
but let's do it for this

669
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,000
example.

670
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So one zero zero was a
solution.

671
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You saw that right away.

672
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Are there any other solutions?

673
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Can you tell me a second
solution to this system of

674
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
equations?

675
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
STUDENTS: 0 -1 1 STRANG:
0 -1 1.

676
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Boy, that's -- 0 -1 1.

677
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Yes.

678
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Because that says I take minus
this column plus this one and

679
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
sure enough.

680
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
That's right.

681
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So there are --
there's a bunch of solutions

682
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
here.

683
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
But they're not a subspace.

684
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,350
I'll tell you what it's like.

685
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:39,000
It's like a plane that doesn't
go through the origin,

686
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
or a line that doesn't go
through the origin.

687
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Maybe in this case it's a line
that doesn't go through the

688
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
origin, if I graft the solutions
to A x equal B.

689
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,300
So you -- I think you've got
the idea.

690
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,000
Subspaces have to go through
the origin.

691
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
If I'm looking at x-s,
then they'd better solve Ax=0.

692
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
In a way I've got -- my two
subspaces that I --

693
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
talking about today are kind of
the two ways I can tell you what

694
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,460
a -- about subspace.

695
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,000
If I want to tell you about the
column space,

696
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I tell you a few columns and I
say take their combinations.

697
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,910
Like I build up this subspace.

698
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,710
I put in a few vectors,
their combinations make a

699
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,000
subspace.

700
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Now, when I went to -- let me
come back to the one that is a

701
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
subspace here.

702
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Here, when I talked about the
null space, I didn't tell you

703
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
what's in it.

704
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
We had to figure out what was
in it.

705
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
What I told you was the
equations that I'm -- that has

706
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
to be satisfied.

707
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You see those -- like,
those are the two natural ways

708
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,990
to tell you what's in a
subspace.

709
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:05,880
I can either give you a few
vectors and say fill it out,

710
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,000
take combinations --
or I can give you a system of

711
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
equations, the requirements that
the x-s have to satisfy.

712
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And both of those ways produce
subspaces and they're the

713
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,540
important ways to construct
subspaces.

714
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,000
Okay, so today's lecture
actually got,

715
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
the essentials of three point
two, the idea of the null space.

716
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Now we have to tackle,
Wednesday, the job of how do we

717
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
actually get hold of that
subspace in an example that's

718
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
bigger and we can't see it just
by eye.

719
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Okay.

720
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
See you Wednesday.

721
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Thanks.
