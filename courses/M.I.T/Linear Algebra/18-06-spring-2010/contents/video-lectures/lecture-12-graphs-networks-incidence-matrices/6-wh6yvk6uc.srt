1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,000
OK.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is lecture twelve.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We've reached twelve lectures.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And this one is more than the
others about applications of

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
linear algebra.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And I'll confess.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,460
When I'm giving you examples of
the null space and the row

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,900
space, I create a little matrix.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,000
You probably see that I just
invent that matrix as I'm going.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And I feel a little guilty
about it, because the truth is

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that real linear algebra uses
matrices that come from

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,340
somewhere.

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,000
They're not just,
like, randomly invented by the

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
instructor.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,300
They come from applications.

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,000
They have a definite structure.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And anybody who works with them
gets, uses that structure.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,650
I'll just report,
like, this weekend I was at an

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,000
event with chemistry professors.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
OK, those guys are row reducing
matrices, and what matrices are

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
they working with?

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, their little matrices
tell them how much of each

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
element goes into the -- or each
molecule, how many molecules of

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
each go into a reaction and what
comes out.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And by row reduction they get a
clearer picture of a complicated

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
reaction.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And this weekend I'm going to
-- to a sort of birthday party

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,700
at Mathworks.

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,000
So Mathworks is out Route 9 in
Natick.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's where Matlab is created.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's a very,
very successful,

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
software, tremendously
successful.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And the conference will be
about how linear algebra is

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,900
used.

35
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,000
And so I feel better today to
talk about what I think is the

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
most important model in applied
math.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,950
And the discrete version is a
graph.

38
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,000
So can I draw a graph?

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Write down the matrix that's
associated with it,

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and that's a great source of
matrices.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,900
You'll see.

42
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,000
So a graph is just,
so a graph -- to repeat -- has

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
nodes and edges.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
OK.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And I'm going to write down the
graph, a graph,

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
so I'm just creating a small
graph here.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
As I mentioned last time,
we would be very interested in

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the graph of all,
websites.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Or the graph of all telephones.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I mean -- or the graph of all
people in the world.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Here let me take just,
maybe nodes one two three --

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
well, I better put in an -- I'll
put in that edge and maybe an

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,300
edge to, to a node four,
and another edge to node four.

54
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,000
How's that?

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So there's a graph with four
nodes.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So n will be four in my -- n
equal four nodes.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And the matrix will have m
equal the number -- there'll be

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
a row for every edge,
so I've got one two three four

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
five edges.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So that will be the number of
rows.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,170
And I have to to write down the
matrix that I want to,

62
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,540
I want to study,
I need to give a direction to

63
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,000
every edge, so I know a plus and
a minus direction.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So I'll just do that with an
arrow.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Say from one to two,
one to three,

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
two to three,
one to four,

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
three to four.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That just tells me,
if I have current flowing on

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
these edges then I know whether
it's -- to count it as positive

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
or negative according as whether
it's with the arrow or against

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
the arrow.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But I just drew those arrows
arbitrarily.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
OK.
Because I --
my example is going to come --

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
the example I'll -- the words
that I will use will be words

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,330
like potential,
potential difference,

76
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,000
currents.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In other words,
I'm thinking of an electrical

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
network.
But that's just one
possibility.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
My applied math class builds on
this example.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It could be a hydraulic
network, so we could be doing,

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
flow of water,
flow of oil.

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Other examples,
this could be a structure.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,390
Like the -- a design for a
bridge or a design for a

84
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,000
Buckminster Fuller dome.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Or many other possibilities,
so many.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So l- but let's take potentials
and currents as,

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
as a basic example,
and let me create the matrix

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
that tells you exactly what the
graph tells you.

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So now I'll call it the
incidence matrix,

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,100
incidence matrix.

91
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,000
OK.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So let me write it down,
and you'll see,

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
what its properties are.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So every row corresponds to an
edge.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I have five rows from five
edges, and let me write down

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
again what this graph looks
like.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
OK, the first edge,
edge one, goes from node one to

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,250
two.

99
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:21,000
So I'm going to put in a minus
one and a plus one in th- this

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,510
corresponds to node one two
three and four,
That's a basis for the null
space.

101
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,220
the four columns.

102
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:33,000
The five rows correspond -- the
first row corresponds to edge

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
one.
Edge one leaves node one and
goes into node two,

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and that --
and it doesn't touch three and

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
four.

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Edge two, edge two goes -- oh,
I haven't numbered these edges.

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I just figured that was
probably edge one,

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
but I didn't say so.

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let me take that to be edge
one.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Let me take this to be edge
two.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Let me take this to be edge
three.

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,100
This is edge four.

113
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,000
Ho, I'm discovering -- no,
wait a minute.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Did I number that twice?

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,120
Here's edge four.

116
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,680
And here's edge five.

117
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:09,000
OK?

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
All right.

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So, so edge one,
as I said, goes from node one

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
to two.

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Edge two goes from two to
three, node two to three,

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
so minus one and one in the
second and third columns.

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Edge three goes from one to
three.

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm, I'm tempted to stop for a
moment with those three edges.

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Edges one two three,
those form what would we,

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
what do you call the,
the little, the little,

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
the subgraph formed by edges
one, two, and three?

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's a loop.

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,320
And the number of loops and the
position of the loops will be

130
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,000
crucial.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
OK.
Actually, here's a interesting
point about loops.

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If I look at those rows,
corresponding to edges one two

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
three, and these guys made a
loop.

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You want to tell me -- if I
just looked at that much of the

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
matrix it would be natural for
me to ask, are those rows

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
independent?

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Are the rows independent?

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And can you tell from looking
at that if they are or are not

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,490
independent?

140
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,000
Do you see a,
a relation between those three

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
rows?

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes.

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If I add that row to that row,
I get this row.

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So, so that's like a hint here
that loops correspond to

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
dependent, linearly dependent
column -- linearly dependent

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
rows.
OK, let me complete the
incidence matrix.

147
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Number four,
edge four is going from node

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
one to node four.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And the fifth edge is going
from node three to node four.

150
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,000
OK.
There's my matrix.

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It came from the five edges and
the four nodes.

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And if I had a big graph,
I'd have a big matrix.

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And what questions do I ask
about matrices?

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Can I ask -- here's the review
now.

155
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
There's a matrix that comes
from somewhere.

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If, if it was a big graph,
it would be a large matrix,

157
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
but a lot of zeros,
right?

158
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Because every row only has two
non-zeros.

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So the number of -- it's a very
sparse matrix.

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,150
The number of non-zeros is
exactly two times five,

161
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,000
it's two m.

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Every row only has two
non-zeros.

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And that's with a lot of
structure.

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And -- that was the point I
wanted to begin with,

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
that graphs,
that real graphs from real --

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
real matrices from genuine
problems have structure.

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
OK.
We can ask, and because of the
structure, we can answer,

168
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
the, the main questions about
matrices.

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So first question,
what about the null space?

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So what I asking if I ask you
for the null space of that

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
matrix?
I'm asking you if I'm looking
at the columns of the matrix,

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
four columns,
and I'm asking you,
So there's a basis for it,
and here is the whole null

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
are those columns independent?

174
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,600
If the columns are independent,
then what's in the null space?

175
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,000
Only the zero vector,
right?

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The null space contains --
tells us what combinations of

177
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
the columns -- it tells us how
to combine columns to get zero.

178
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Can -- and is there anything in
the null space of this matrix

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
other than just the zero vector?

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
In other words,
are those four columns

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,960
independent or dependent?
What else is in the null space?

182
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,000
OK.

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's our question.

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Let me, I don't know if you see
the answer.

185
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Whether there's -- so let's
see.

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,600
I guess we could do it
properly.

187
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,000
We could solve Ax=0.

188
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So let me solve Ax=0 to find
the null space.

189
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,000
OK.
What's Ax?

190
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Can I put x in here in,
in little letters?

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
x1, x2, x3, x4,
that's -- it's got four

192
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
columns.

193
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,600
Ax now is that matrix times x.

194
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,000
And what do I get for Ax?

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
If the camera can keep that
matrix multiplication there,

196
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll put the answer here.

197
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,470
Ax equal -- what's the first
component of Ax?

198
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:34,000
Can you take that first row,
minus one one zero zero,

199
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and multiply by the x,
and of course you get x2-x1.

200
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The second row,
I get x3-x2.

201
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
From the third row,
I get x3-x1.

202
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
From the fourth row,
I get x4-x1.

203
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And from the fifth row,
I get x4-x3.

204
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And I want to know when is the
thing zero.

205
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This is my equation,
Ax=0.

206
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Notice what that matrix A is
doing, what we've created a

207
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
matrix that computes the
differences across every edge,

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
the differences in potential.
differences are zero,
and that x is in the null

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Let me even begin to give this
interpretation.

210
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,120
I'm going to think of this
vector x, which is x1 x2 x3 x4,

211
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,000
as the potentials at the nodes.

212
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So I'm introducing a word,
potentials at the nodes.

213
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And now if I multiply by A,
I get these -- I get these five

214
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
components, x2-x1,
et cetera.

215
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And what are they?

216
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
They're potential differences.

217
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That's what A computes.

218
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If I have potentials at the
nodes and I multiply by A,

219
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
it gives me the potential
differences, the differences in

220
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
potential, across the edges.

221
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,000
OK.
When are those differences all
zero?

222
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,000
So I'm looking for the null
space.

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Of course, if all the (x)s are
zero then I get zero.

224
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That, that just tells me,
of course, the zero vector is

225
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
in the null space.

226
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But w- there's more in the null
space.

227
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Those columns are -- of A are
dependent, right --

228
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
because I can find solutions to
that equation.

229
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Tell me -- the null space.

230
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,040
Tell me one vector in the null
space, so tell me an x,

231
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,000
it's got four components,
and it makes that thing zero.

232
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So what's a good x to do that?

233
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
One one one one,
constant potential.

234
00:15:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If the potentials are constant,
then all the potential

235
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:28,000
space.

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If it -- yeah,
let me ask you just always,

237
00:08:52,000 --> 00:07:38,000
give me a basis for the null
space.

238
00:07:38,000 --> 00:05:37,000
A basis for the null space will
be just that.1

239
00:05:37,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's --, that's it.

240
00:07:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The null space is actually one
dimensional, and it's the line

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
of all vectors through that one.

242
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:48,000
space.

243
00:12:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Any multiple of one one one
one, it's the whole line in four

244
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
dimensional space.

245
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Do you see that that's the null
space?

246
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So the, so the dimension of the
null space of A is one.

247
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And there's a basis for it,
and there's everything that's

248
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
in it.

249
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Good.
And what does that mean
physically?

250
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,000
I mean, what does that mean in
the application?

251
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That guy in the null space.

252
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It means that the potentials
can only be determined up to a

253
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
constant.

254
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Potential differences are what
make current flow.

255
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's what makes things
happen.

256
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's these potential
differences that will make

257
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
something move in the,
in our network,

258
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
between x2- between node two
and node one.

259
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Nothing will move if all
potentials are the same.

260
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
If all potentials are c,
c, c, and c,

261
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,190
then nothing will move.

262
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,000
So we're, we have this one
parameter, this arbitrary

263
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
constant that raises or drops
all the potentials.

264
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's like ranking football
teams, whatever.

265
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
We have a, there's a,
there's a constant -- or

266
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
looking at temperatures,
you know, there's a flow of

267
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,900
heat from higher temperature to
lower temperature.

268
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,000
If temperatures are equal
there's no flow,

269
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and therefore we can measure --
we can measure temperatures by,

270
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Celsius or we can start at
absolute zero.

271
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And that arbitrary -- it's the
same arbitrary constant that,

272
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
that was there in calculus.

273
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
In calculus,
right, when you took the

274
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
integral, the indefinite
integral, there was a plus c,

275
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and you had to set a starting
point to know what that c was.

276
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,180
So here what often happens is
we fix one of the potentials,

277
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,000
like the last one.

278
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So a typical thing would be to
ground that node.

279
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
To set its potential at zero.

280
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,960
And if we do that,
if we fix that potential so

281
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,000
it's not unknown anymore,
then that column disappears and

282
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
we have three columns,
and those three columns are

283
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
independent.

284
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So I'll leave the column in
there, but we'll remember that

285
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
grounding a node is the way to
get it out.

286
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And grounding a node is the way
to -- setting a node -- setting

287
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
a potential to zero tells us
the, the base for all

288
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
potentials.

289
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,460
Then we can compute the others.

290
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:50,000
OK.

291
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
But what's the --
now I've talked enough to ask

292
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
what the rank of the matrix is?

293
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What's the rank then?

294
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
The rank of the matrix.

295
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So we have a five by four
matrix.

296
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We've located its null space,
one dimensional.

297
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
How many independent columns do
we have?

298
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,400
What's the rank?

299
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,000
It's three.

300
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And the first three columns,
or actually any three columns,

301
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
will be independent.

302
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Any three potentials are
independent, good variables.

303
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The fourth potential is not,
we need to set,

304
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and typically we ground that
node.

305
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
OK.

306
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,320
Rank is three.

307
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,000
Rank equals three.

308
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,150
OK.

309
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,000
Let's see, do I want to ask you
about the column space?

310
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The column space is all
combinations of those columns.

311
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,400
I could say more about it and I
will.

312
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,000
Let me go to the null space of
A transpose, because the

313
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
equation A transpose y equals
zero is probably the most

314
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
fundamental equation of applied
mathematics.

315
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
All right, let's talk about
that.

316
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,600
That deserves our attention.

317
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,000
A transpose y equals zero.

318
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,400
Let's -- let me put it on here.

319
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:26,000
OK.

320
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So A transpose y equals zero.

321
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So now I'm finding the null
space of A transpose.

322
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Oh, and if I ask you its
dimension, you could tell me

323
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
what it is.

324
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What's the dimension of the
null space of A transpose?

325
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
We now know enough to answer
that question.

326
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What's the general formula for
the dimension of the null space

327
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
of A transpose?

328
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
A transpose,
let me even write out A

329
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
transpose.

330
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,260
This A transpose will be n by
m, right?

331
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:07,000
n by m.

332
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
In this case,
it'll be four by five.

333
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,900
Those columns will become rows.

334
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:23,000
Minus one zero minus one minus
one zero is now the first row.

335
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The second row of the matrix,
one minus one and three zeros.

336
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
The third column now becomes
the third row,

337
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,400
zero one one zero minus one.

338
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,000
And the fourth column becomes
the fourth row.

339
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,900
OK, good.

340
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,000
There's A transpose.

341
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That multiplies y,
y1 y2 y3 y4 and y5.

342
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,000
OK.
Now you've had time to think
about this question.

343
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What's the dimension of the
null space, if I set all those

344
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,000
-- wow.
Usually -- sometime during this
semester, I'll drop one of these

345
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
erasers behind there.

346
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
That's a great moment.

347
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There's no recovery.

348
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
There's -- centuries of erasers
are back there.

349
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,380
OK.

350
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:38,500
OK, what's the dimension of the
null space?

351
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:45,000
Give me the general formula
first in terms of r and m and n.

352
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
This is like crucial,
you -- we struggled to,

353
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
to decide what dimension meant,
and then we figured out what it

354
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,000
equaled for an m by n matrix of
rank r, and the answer was m-r,

355
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,750
right?

356
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:14,000
There are m=5 components,
m=5 columns of A transpose.

357
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And r of those columns are
pivot columns,

358
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
because it'll have r pivots.

359
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It has rank r.

360
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And m-r are the free ones now
for A transpose,

361
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,900
so that's five minus three,
so that's two.

362
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,000
And I would like to find this
null space.

363
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I know its dimension.

364
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Now I want to find out a basis
for it.

365
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And I want to understand what
this equation is.

366
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So let me say what A transpose
y actually represents,

367
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
why I'm interested in that
equation.

368
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'll put it down with those old
erasers and continue this.

369
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Here's the great picture of
applied mathematics.

370
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So let me complete that.

371
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
There's a matrix that I'll call
C that connects potential

372
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
differences to currents.

373
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,720
So I'll call these --
these are currents on the

374
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,070
edges, y1 y2 y3 y4 and y5.

375
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,000
Those are currents on the
edges.

376
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And this relation between
current and potential difference

377
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
is Ohm's Law.

378
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
This here is Ohm's Law.

379
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Ohm's Law says that the current
on an edge is some number times

380
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,900
the potential drop.

381
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,000
That's -- and that number is
the conductance of the edge,

382
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
one over the resistance.

383
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
This is the old current is,
is, the relation of current,

384
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
resistance, and change in
potential.

385
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So it's a change in potential
that makes some current happen,

386
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
and it's Ohm's Law that says
how much current happens.

387
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,000
OK.
And then the final step of this
framework is the equation A

388
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,000
transpose y equals zero.

389
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And that's -- what is that
saying?

390
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It has a famous name.

391
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's Kirchoff's Current Law,
KCL, Kirchoff's Current Law,

392
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,200
A transpose y equals zero.

393
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,000
So that when I'm solving,
and when I go back up with this

394
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
blackboard and solve A transpose
y equals zero,

395
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
it's this pattern of -- that I
want you to see.

396
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That we had rectangular
matrices, but -- and real

397
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
applications,
but in those real applications

398
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
comes A and A transpose.

399
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So our four subspaces are
exactly the right things to know

400
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
about.

401
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
All right.

402
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Let's know about that null
space of A transpose.

403
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Wait a minute,
where'd it go?

404
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
There it is.

405
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
OK.

406
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,000
OK.
Null space of A transpose.

407
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
We know what its dimension
should be.

408
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Let's find out -- tell me a
vector in it.

409
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Tell me -- now,
so what I asking you?

410
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm asking you for five
currents that satisfy Kirchoff's

411
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Current Law.

412
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So we better understand what
that law says.

413
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
That, that law,
A transpose y equals zero,

414
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
what does that say,
say in the first row of A

415
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
transpose?

416
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
That says -- the so the first
row of A transpose says minus y1

417
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
minus y3 minus y4 is zero.

418
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Where did that equation come
from?

419
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,700
Let me -- I'll redraw the
graph.

420
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,000
Can I redraw the graph here,
so that we -- maybe here,

421
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
so that we see again -- there
was node one,

422
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,020
node two, node three,
node four was off here.

423
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,000
That was, that was our graph.

424
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
We had currents on those.

425
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
We had a current y1 going
there.

426
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
We had a current y --
what were the other,

427
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
what are those edge numbers?
y4 here and y3 here.

428
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And then a y2 and a y5.

429
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'm, I'm just copying what was
on the other board so it's ea-

430
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
convenient to see it.

431
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
What is this equation telling
me, this first equation of

432
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Kirchoff's Current Law?

433
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
What does that mean for that
graph?

434
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Well, I see y1,
y3, and y4 as the currents

435
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,570
leaving node one.

436
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,000
So sure enough,
the first equation refers to

437
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
node one, and what does it say?

438
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It says that the net flow is
zero.

439
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,420
That, that equation A transpose
y, Kirchoff's Current Law,

440
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:44,000
is a balance equation,
a conservation law.

441
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Physicists, be overjoyed,
right, by this stuff.

442
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It, it says that in equals out.

443
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And in this case,
the three arrows are all going

444
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
out, so it says y1,
y3, and y4 add to zero.

445
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Let's take the next one.

446
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
The second row is y1-y2,
and that's all that's in that

447
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,950
row.

448
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:16,000
And that must have something to
do with node two.

449
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And sure enough,
it says y1=y2,

450
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,310
current in equals current out.

451
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:29,000
The third one,
y2 plus y3 minus y5 equals

452
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,000
zero.
That certainly will be what's
up at the third node.

453
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
y2 coming in,
y3 coming in,

454
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
y5 going out has to balance.

455
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And finally,
y4 plus y5 equals zero says

456
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,080
that at this node,
y4 plus y5, the total flow,

457
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,000
is zero.

458
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
We don't -- you know,
charge doesn't accumulate at

459
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
the nodes.

460
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It travels around.

461
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,000
OK.
Now give me -- I come back now
to the linear algebra question.

462
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
What's a vector y that solves
these equations?

463
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Can I figure out what the null
space is for this matrix,

464
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,700
A transpose,
by looking at the graph?

465
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,420
I'm happy if I don't have to do
elimination.

466
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,000
I can do elimination,
we know how to do,

467
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
we know how to find the null
space basis.

468
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We can do elimination on this
matrix, and we'll get it into a

469
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
good reduced row echelon form,
and the special solutions will

470
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
pop right out.

471
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But I would like to -- even to
do it without that.

472
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Let me just ask you first,
if I did elimination on that,

473
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
on that, matrix,
what would the last row become?

474
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
What would the last row -- if I
do elimination on that matrix,

475
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
the last row of R will be all
zeros, right?

476
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Why?
Because the rank is three.

477
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
We only going to have three
pivots.

478
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And the fourth row will be all
zeros when we eliminate.

479
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
So elimination will tell us
what, what we spotted earlier,

480
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
what's the null space -- all
the, all the information,

481
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,400
what are the dependencies.

482
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,000
We'll find those by
elimination, but here in a real

483
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
example, we can find them by
thinking.

484
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,000
OK.
Again, my question is,
what is a solution y?

485
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
How could current travel around
this network without collecting

486
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,500
any charge at the nodes?

487
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,000
Tell me a y.

488
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
OK.

489
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So a basis for the null space
of A transpose.

490
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
How many vectors I looking for?

491
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Two.

492
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,480
It's a two dimensional space.

493
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,000
My basis should have two
vectors in it.

494
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Give me one.

495
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
One set of currents.

496
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Suppose, let me start it.

497
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Let me start with y1 as one.

498
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,000
OK.
So one unit of -- one amp
travels on edge one with the

499
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
arrow.

500
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
OK, then what?

501
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
What is y2?

502
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's one also,
right?

503
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And of course what you did was
solve Kirchoff's Current Law

504
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
quickly in the second equation.

505
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
OK.

506
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Now we've got one amp leaving
node one, coming around to node

507
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,000
three.
What shall we do now?

508
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Well, what shall I take for y3
in other words?

509
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh, I've got a choice,
but why not make it what you

510
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
said, negative one.

511
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So I have just sent current,
one amp, around that loop.

512
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
What shall y4 and y5 be in this
case?

513
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
We could take them to be zero.

514
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,680
This satisfies Kirchoff's
Current Law.

515
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,000
We could check it patiently,
that minus y1 minus y3 gives

516
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
zero.

517
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
We know y1 is y2.

518
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
The others, y4 plus y5 is
certainly zero.

519
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Any current around a loop
satisfies -- satisfies the

520
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,390
Current Law.

521
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:46,000
OK.

522
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Now you know how to get another
one.

523
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,900
Take current around this loop.

524
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:00,000
So now let y3 be one,
y5 be one, and y4 be minus one.

525
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And so, so we have the first
basis vector sent current around

526
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
that loop, the second basis
vector sends current around that

527
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,000
loop.
And I've -- and those are
independent, and I've got two

528
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
solutions --
two vectors in the null space

529
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
of A transpose,
two solutions to Kirchoff's

530
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Current Law.

531
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Of course you would say what
about sending current around the

532
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
big loop.

533
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
What about that vector?

534
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
One for y1, one for y2,
nothing f- on y3,

535
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,300
one for y5, and minus one for
y4.

536
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,000
What about that?

537
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Is that, is that in the null
space of A transpose?

538
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Sure.
So why don't we now have a
third vector in the basis?

539
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Because it's not independent,
right?

540
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It's not independent.

541
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
This vector is the sum of those
two.

542
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,400
If I send current around that
and around that --

543
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,000
then on this edge y3 it's going
to cancel out and I'll have

544
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
altogether current around the
whole, the outside loop.

545
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
That's what this one is,
but it's a combination of those

546
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
two.

547
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Do you see that I've now,
I've identified the null space

548
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
of A transpose --
but more than that,

549
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
we've solved Kirchoff's Current
Law.

550
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And understood it in terms of
the network.

551
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,000
OK.
So that's the null space of A
transpose.

552
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,500
I guess I -- there's always one
more space to ask you about.

553
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:01,000
Let's see, I guess I need the
row space of A,

554
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
the column space of A
transpose.

555
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So what's N,
what's its dimension?

556
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,960
Yup?

557
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:18,000
What's the dimension of the row
space of A?

558
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
If I look at the original A,
it had five rows.

559
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
How many were independent?

560
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Oh, I guess I'm asking you the
rank again, right?

561
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And the answer is three,
right?

562
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,360
Three independent rows.

563
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,000
When I transpose it,
there's three independent

564
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
columns.

565
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,750
Are those columns independent,
those three?

566
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:45,000
The first three columns,
are they the pivot columns of

567
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
the matrix?

568
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,000
No.
Those three columns are not
independent.

569
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
There's a in fact,
this tells me a relation

570
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,250
between them.

571
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,000
There's a vector in the null
space that says the first column

572
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
plus the second column equals
the third column.

573
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,780
They're not independent because
they come from a loop.

574
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:12,000
So the pivot columns,
the pivot columns of this

575
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
matrix will be the first,
the second, not the third,

576
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
but the fourth.

577
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
One, columns one,
two, and four are OK.

578
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Where are they -- those are the
columns of A transpose,

579
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
those correspond to edges.

580
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So there's edge one,
there's edge two,

581
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and there's edge four.

582
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
So there's a --
that's like -- is a,

583
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
smaller graph.

584
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
If I just look at the part of
the graph that I've,

585
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,660
that I've, thick -- used with
thick edges, it has the same

586
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,000
four nodes.

587
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
It only has three edges.

588
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,800
And the, those edges correspond
to the independent guys.

589
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,000
And in the graph there -- those
three edges have no loop,

590
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
right?

591
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
The independent ones are the
ones that don't have a loop.

592
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
All the -- dependencies came
from loops.

593
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,420
They were the things in the
null space of A transpose.

594
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,000
If I take three pivot columns,
there are no dependencies among

595
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
them, and they form a graph
without a loop,

596
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and I just want to ask you
what's the name for a graph

597
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
without a loop?

598
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So a graph without a loop is --
has got not very many edges,

599
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
right?

600
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I've got four nodes and it only
has three edges,

601
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,900
and if I put another edge in,
I would have a loop.

602
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:58,000
So it's this graph with no
loops, and it's the one where

603
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
the rows of A are independent.

604
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And what's a graph called that
has no loops?

605
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's called a tree.

606
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,720
So a tree is the name for a
graph with no loops.

607
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,000
And just to take one last step
here.

608
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Using our formula for
dimension.

609
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Using our formula for
dimension, let's look -- once at

610
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
this formula.

611
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:47,000
The dimension of the null space
of A transpose is m-r.

612
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,520
OK.

613
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:58,000
This is the number of loops,
number of independent loops.

614
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
m is the number of edges.

615
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,300
And what is r?

616
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,000
What is r for our -- we'll have
to remember way back.

617
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,000
The rank came -- from looking
at the columns of our matrix.

618
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,880
So what's the rank?

619
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,000
Let's just remember.

620
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Rank was -- you remember there
was one -- we had a one

621
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
dimensional --
rank was n minus one,

622
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
that's what I'm struggling to
say.

623
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Because there were n columns
coming from the n nodes,

624
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
so it's minus,
the number of nodes minus one,

625
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
because of that C,
that one one one one vector in

626
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
the null space.

627
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
The columns were not
independent.

628
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
There was one dependency,
so we needed n minus one.

629
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
This is a great formula.

630
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,000
This is like the first shall I,
-- write it slightly

631
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
differently?

632
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:17,400
The number of edges -- let me
put things -- have I got it

633
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,250
right?

634
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:24,360
Number of edges is m,
the number -- r- is m-r,

635
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:24,700
OK.

636
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:31,000
So, so I'm getting -- let me
put the number of nodes on the

637
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
other side.

638
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,000
So I -- the number of nodes --
I'll move that to the other side

639
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,390
-- minus the number of edges
plus the number of loops is -- I

640
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:50,000
have minus, minus one is one.

641
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
The number of nodes minus the
number of edges plus the number

642
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
of loops is one.

643
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
These are like zero dimensional
guys.

644
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
They're the points on the
graph.

645
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
The edges are like one
dimensional things,

646
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,770
they're, they connect nodes.

647
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,640
The loops are like two
dimensional things.

648
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,300
They have, like,
an area.

649
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,000
And this count works for every
graph.

650
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And it's known as Euler's
Formula.

651
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
We see Euler again,
that guy never stopped.

652
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,000
OK.
And can we just check -- so
what I saying?

653
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:36,500
I'm saying that linear algebra
proves Euler's Formula.

654
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,000
Euler's Formula is this great
topology fact about any graph.

655
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,730
I'll draw, let me draw another
graph, let me draw a graph with

656
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,520
more edges and loops.

657
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,000
Let me put in lots of -- OK.

658
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I just drew a graph there.

659
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
So what are the,
what are the quantities in that

660
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
formula?

661
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
How many nodes have I got?

662
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Looks like five.

663
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
How many edges have I got?

664
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
One two three four five six
seven.

665
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
How many loops have I got?

666
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
One two three.

667
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And Euler's right,
I always get one.

668
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That, this formula,
is extremely useful in

669
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
understanding the relation of
these quantities --

670
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
the number of nodes,
the number of edges,

671
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
and the number of loops.

672
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,000
OK.
Just complete this lecture by
completing this picture,

673
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
this cycle.

674
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:52,000
So let me come to the -- so
this expresses the equations of

675
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,800
applied math.

676
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,000
This, let me call these
potential differences,

677
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,000
say, E.
So E is A x.

678
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
That's the equation for this
step.

679
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,590
The currents come from the
potential differences.

680
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,000
y is C E.

681
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,000
The potential -- the currents
satisfy Kirchoff's Current Law.

682
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Those are the equations of --
with no source terms.

683
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Those are the equations of
electrical circuits of many --

684
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
those are like the,
the most basic three equations.

685
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Applied math comes in this
structure.

686
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
The only thing I haven't got
yet in the picture is an outside

687
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
source to make something happen.

688
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I could add a current source
here, I could,

689
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I could add external currents
going in and out of nodes.

690
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I could add batteries in the
edges.

691
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Those are two ways.

692
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
If I add batteries in the
edges, they, they come into

693
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
here.

694
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Let me add current sources.

695
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
If I add current sources,
those come in here.

696
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So there's a,
there's where current sources

697
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
go, because the F is a like a
current coming from outside.

698
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
So we have our edges,
we have our graph,

699
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
and then I send one amp into
this node and out of this node

700
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
--
and that gives me,

701
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
a right-hand side in Kirchoff's
Current Law.

702
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And can I -- to complete the
lecture, I'm just going to put

703
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
these three equations together.

704
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So I start with x,
my unknown.

705
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I multiply by A.

706
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
That gives me the potential
differences.

707
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:58,000
That was our matrix A that the
whole thing started with.

708
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I multiply by C.

709
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Those are the physical
constants in Ohm's Law.

710
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Now I have y.

711
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I multiply y by A transpose,
and now I have F.

712
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So there is the whole thing.

713
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
There's the basic equation of
applied math.

714
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Coming from these three steps,
in which the last step is this

715
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
balance equation.

716
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
There's always a balance
equation to look for.

717
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
These are the -- when I say the
most basic equations of applied

718
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
mathematics --
I should say,

719
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
in equilibrium.

720
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,070
Time isn't in this problem.

721
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:43,000
I'm not -- and Newton's Law
isn't acting here.

722
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I'm, I'm looking at the --
equations when everything has

723
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
settled down,
how do the currents distribute

724
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
in the network.

725
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And of course there are big
codes to solve the -- this is

726
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
the basic problem of numerical
linear algebra for systems of

727
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,850
equations, because that's how
they come.

728
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:11,000
And my final question.

729
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,500
What can you tell me about this
matrix A transpose C A?

730
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,000
Or even A transpose A?

731
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I'll just close with that
question.

732
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
What do you know about the
matrix A transpose A?

733
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It is always symmetric,
right.

734
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
OK, thank.

735
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:38,000
So I'll see you Wednesday for a
full review of these chapters,

736
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
and Friday you get to tell me.

737
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Thanks.
