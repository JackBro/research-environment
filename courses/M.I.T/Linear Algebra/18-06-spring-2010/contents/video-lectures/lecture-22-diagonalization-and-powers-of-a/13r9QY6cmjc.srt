1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
OK.
Shall we start?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is the second lecture on
eigenvalues.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,590
So the first lecture was --
reached the key equation,

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:29,000
A x equal lambda x.
x is the eigenvector and

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
lambda's the eigenvalue.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now to use that.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And the, the good way to,
after we've found -- so,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
so job one is to find the
eigenvalues and find the

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
eigenvectors.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,990
Now after we've found them,
what do we do with them?

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,000
Well, the good way to see that
is diagonalize the matrix.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So the matrix is A.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And I want to show -- first of
all, this is like

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the basic fact.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This, this formula.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's, that's the key to
today's lecture.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This matrix A,
I put its eigenvectors in the

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
columns of a matrix S.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So S will be the eigenvector
matrix.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And I want to look at this
magic combination S inverse A S.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So can I show you how that --
what happens there?

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And notice, there's an S
inverse.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We have to be able to invert
this eigenvector matrix S.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So for that,
we need n independent

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
eigenvectors.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So that's the,
that's the case.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,000
OK.
So suppose we have n linearly
independent eigenvectors

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
of A.
Put them in the columns of this
matrix S.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So I'm naturally going to call
that the eigenvector matrix,

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
because it's got the
eigenvectors in its columns.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And all I want to do is show
you what happens when you

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
multiply A times S.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So A times S.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So this is A times the matrix
with

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
the first eigenvector in its
first column,

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the second eigenvector in its
second column,

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the n-th eigenvector in its
n-th column.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And how I going to do this
matrix multiplication?

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well, certainly I'll do it a
column at a time.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And what do I get.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A times the first column gives
me the first column of the

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
answer, but what is it?

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's an eigenvector.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
A times x1 is equal to the
lambda times the x1.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And that lambda's we're --
we'll call lambda one,

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
of course.
So that's the first column.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Ax1 is the same as lambda one
x1.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A x2 is lambda two x2.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So on, along to in the n-th
column we now how lambda n xn.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Looking good,
but the next step is even

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000
better.
So for the next step,
I want to separate out those

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
eigenvalues, those,
those multiplying numbers,

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
from the x-s.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So then I'll have just what I
want.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
OK.
So how, how I going to separate
out?

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So that, that number lambda one
is multiplying the first column.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So if I want to factor it out
of the first column,

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I better put -- here is going
to be x1, and that's going to

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
multiply this
matrix lambda one in the first

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
entry and all zeros.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Do you see that that,
that's going to come out right

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
for the first column?

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Because w- we remember how --
how we're going back to that

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
original punchline.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That if I want a number to
multiply x1 then I can do it by

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
putting x1 in that
column, in the first column,

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and putting that number there.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,130
Th- u- what I going to have
here?

69
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm going to have lambda -- I'm
going to have x1,

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
x2, ...
,xn.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
These are going to be my
columns again.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm getting S back again.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm getting S back again.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But now what's it multiplied
by,

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
on the right it's multiplied
by?

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If I want lambda n xn in the
last column, how do I do it?

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, the last column here will
be -- I'll take the last column,

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
use these coefficients,
put the lambda n down there,

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and it will multiply that n-th
column and give me lambda n xn.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
There, there you see matrix
multiplication just working for

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
us.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So I started with A S.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I wrote down what it meant,
A times each eigenvector.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That gave me lambda time the
eigenvector.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And then when I peeled off the
lambdas, they were on the

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
right-hand side,
so I've got S,

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,480
my matrix, back again.

88
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,000
And this matrix,
this diagonal matrix,

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
the eigenvalue matrix,
and I call it capital lambda.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Using capital letters for
matrices and lambda to prompt me

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
that it's, that it's eigenvalues
that are in there.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So you see that the eigenvalues
are just sitting down that

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
diagonal?

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If I had a column x2 here,
I

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
would want the lambda two in
the two two position,

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
in the diagonal position,
to multiply that x2 and give me

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the lambda two x2.

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's my formula.

99
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
A S is S lambda.

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
OK.
That's the -- you see,
it's just a calculation.

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Now -- I mentioned,
and I

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
have to mention again,
this business about n

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
independent eigenvectors.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
As it stands,
this is all fine,

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
whether -- I mean,
I could be repeating the same

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
eigenvector, but -- I'm not
interested in that.

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I want to be able to invert S,
and that's where this comes in.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,540
This n independent eigenvectors
business comes in to tell me

109
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,000
that that matrix is invertible.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So let me, on the next board,
write down what I've got.

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
A S equals S lambda.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And now I'm,
I can multiply on the left by S

113
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
inverse.

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So this is really --
I can do that,

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
provided S is invertible.

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Provided my assumption of n
independent eigenvectors is

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
satisfied.
And I mentioned at the end of
last time, and I'll say again,

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
that there's a small number of
matrices for -- that don't have

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
n independent
eigenvectors.

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,320
So I've got to discuss that,
that technical point.

121
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,000
But the great -- the most
matrices that we see have n di-

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
n independent eigenvectors,
and we can diagonalize.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This is diagonalization.

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I could also write it,
and I often will,

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
the other way round.

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If I multiply on the right by S
inverse, if I took this equation

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
at the top and multiplied on the
right by S inverse,

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I could -- I would have A left
here.

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Now S inverse is coming from
the right.

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So can you keep those two
straight?

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
A multiplies its eigenvectors,
that's how I keep them

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
straight.
So A multiplies S.

133
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
A multiplies S.

134
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And then this S inverse makes
the whole thing diagonal.

135
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And this is another way of
saying the same thing,

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,840
putting the Ss on the other
side of the equation.

137
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,659
A is S lambda S inverse.

138
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,000
So that's the,
that's the new

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
factorization.

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That's the replacement for L U
from elimination or Q R for --

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
from Gram-Schmidt.

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And notice that the matrix --
so it's, it's a matrix times a

143
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
diagonal matrix times the
inverse of the first one.

144
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's, that's the combination
that we'll see throughout this

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
chapter.

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
This combination with an S and
an S inverse.

147
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
OK.
Can I just begin to use that?

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
For example,
what about A squared?

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What are the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of A squared?

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's a straightforward
question with a,

151
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
with an absolutely clean
answer.

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So let me,
let me consider A squared.

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So I start with A x equal
lambda x.

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,370
And I'm headed for A squared.

155
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,320
So let me multiply both sides
by A.

156
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,000
That's one way to get A squared
on the left.

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So -- I should write these if-s
in here.

158
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If A x equals lambda x,
then I multiply by A,

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
so I get A
squared x equals -- well,

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm multiplying by A,
so that's lambda A x.

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That lambda was a number,
so I just put it on the left.

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And what do I -- tell me how to
make that look better.

163
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,840
What have I got here for if,
if A has the eigenvalue lambda

164
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,000
and eigenvector x,
what's

165
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
up with A squared?

166
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
A squared x,
I just multiplied by A,

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
but now for Ax I'm going to
substitute lambda x.

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So I've got lambda squared x.

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So from that simple
calculation, I -- my conclusion

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
is that the eigenvalues of A
squared are lambda squared.

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And the eigenvectors -- I
always think about both of

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
those.
What can I say about the
eigenvalues?

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,060
They're squared.

174
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,000
What can I say about the
eigenvectors?

175
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,430
They're the same.

176
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,000
The same x as in -- as for A.

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Now let me see that also
from this formula.

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
How can I see what A squared is
looking like from this formula?

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So let me -- that was one way
to do it.

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Let me do it by just taking A
squared from that.

181
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
A squared is S lambda S inverse
-- that's A -- times S lambda S

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
inverse -- that's A,
which is?

183
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
This is the beauty of
eigenvalues, eigenvectors.

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Having that S inverse and S is
the identity,

185
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
so I've got S lambda squared S
inverse.

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Do you see what that's telling
me?

187
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's, it's telling me the same
thing that I just learned here,

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
but in the -- in a matrix form.

189
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's telling me that the S is
the same, the eigenvectors are

190
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
the same, but the eigenvalues
are squared.

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Because this is -- what's
lambda squared?

192
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That's still diagonal.

193
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's got little lambda one
squared, lambda two squared,

194
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
down to lambda n squared o- on
that diagonal.

195
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Those are the eigenvalues,
as we just learned,

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
of A
squared.

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
OK.
So -- somehow those eigenvalues
and eigenvectors are really

198
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
giving you a way to -- see
what's going on inside a matrix.

199
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Of course I can continue that
for -- to the K-th power,

200
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
A to the K-th power.

201
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
If I multiply,
if I have K of these together,

202
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
do you see how S inverse S will
keep canceling in the,

203
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
in the inside?

204
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,190
I'll have the S outside at the
far left, and lambda will be in

205
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,000
there K times,
and S inverse.

206
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So what's that telling me?

207
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's telling me that the
eigenvalues of A,

208
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
of A to the K-th power are the
K-th powers.

209
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The eigenvalues of A cubed are
the cubes of the eigenvalues of

210
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,000
A.
And the eigenvectors are the
same, the same.

211
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,000
OK.
In other words,
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

212
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
give a great way to understand
the powers of a matrix.

213
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
If I take the square of a
matrix,

214
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
or the hundredth power of a
matrix, the pivots are all over

215
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
the place.

216
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
L U, if I multiply L U times L
U times L U times L U a hundred

217
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,480
times, I've got a hundred L Us.

218
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,000
I can't do anything with them.

219
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But when I multiply S lambda S
inverse by itself,

220
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
when I look at the eigenvector
picture a hundred times,

221
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I get a hundred or ninety-nine
of these guys canceling out

222
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
inside, and I get A to the
hundredth is S lambda to the

223
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
hundredth S inverse.

224
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,450
I mean, eigenvalues tell you
about powers of a matrix in a

225
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,000
way that we had no way to
approach previously.

226
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
For example,
when does -- when do the powers

227
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
of a matrix go to zero?

228
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I would call that matrix
stable, maybe.

229
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So I could write down a
theorem.

230
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'll write it as a theorem just
to use that word to emphasize

231
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
that here I'm
getting this great fact from

232
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
this eigenvalue picture.

233
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,000
OK.
A to the K approaches zero as K
goes, as K gets bigger if what?

234
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What's the w- how can I tell,
for a matrix A,

235
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
if its powers go to zero?

236
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What's -- somewhere inside that
matrix is that information.

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
That information is not present
in

238
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
the pivots.

239
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's present in the
eigenvalues.

240
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What do I need for the -- to
know that if I take higher and

241
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
higher powers of A,
that this matrix gets smaller

242
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and smaller?

243
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Well, S and S inverse are not
moving.

244
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So it's this guy that has to
get small.

245
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,730
And that's easy to --
to understand.

246
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,000
The requirement is all
eigenvalues -- so what is the

247
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
requirement?

248
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The eigenvalues have to be less
than one.

249
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Now I have to wrote that
absolute value,

250
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
because those eigenvalues could
be negative, they could be

251
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
complex numbers.

252
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So I'm taking the absolute
value.

253
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If all
of those are below one.

254
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That's, in fact,
we practically see why.

255
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And let me just say that I'm
operating on one assumption

256
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
here, and I got to keep
remembering that that assumption

257
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
is still present.

258
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That assumption was that I had
a

259
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
full set of,
of n independent eigenvectors.

260
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If I don't have that,
then this approach is not

261
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
working.

262
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So again, a pure eigenvalue
approach, eigenvector approach,

263
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
needs n independent
eigenvectors.

264
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
If we don't have n independent
eigenvectors,

265
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
we can't diagonalize the
matrix.

266
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We can't get to a diagonal
matrix.

267
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
This diagonalization is only
possible if S inverse makes

268
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
sense.

269
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,000
OK.
Can I, can I follow up on that
point now?

270
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:10,000
So you see why -- what we get
and, and why we want it,

271
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
because we get information
about the

272
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
powers of a matrix just
immediately from the

273
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
eigenvalues.

274
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
OK.

275
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Now let me follow up on this,
business of which matrices are

276
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
diagonalizable.

277
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Sorry about that long word.

278
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So a matrix is,
is sure -- so here's,

279
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
here's the main point.

280
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
A is sure to be -- to have N
independent eigenvectors

281
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:58,000
and, and be -- now here comes
that word -- diagonalizable if,

282
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:09,000
if -- so we might as well get
the nice case out in the open.

283
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The nice case is when -- if all
the lambdas are different.

284
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:31,740
That means, that means no
repeated eigenvalues.

285
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,000
OK.

286
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's the nice case.

287
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
If my matrix,
and most -- if I do a random

288
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:49,000
matrix in Matlab and compute its
eigenvalues -- so if I computed

289
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,000
if I took eig of rand of ten
ten, gave, gave that Matlab

290
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,690
command, the -- we'd get a
random ten by ten matrix,

291
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:10,000
we would get a list of its ten
eigenvalues, and they would be

292
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
different.

293
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
They would be distinct is the
best word.

294
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,950
I would have -- a random matrix
will have ten distinct -- a ten

295
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,000
by ten matrix will have ten
distinct eigenvalues.

296
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,930
And if it does,
the eigenvectors

297
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,000
are automatically independent.

298
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So that's a nice fact.

299
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'll refer you to the text for
the proof.

300
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That, that A is sure to have n
independent eigenvectors if the

301
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
eigenvalues are different,
if.

302
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
If all the, if all eigenvalues
are different.

303
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's just if some lambdas are
repeated, then I have to look

304
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
more
closely.

305
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
If an eigenvalue is repeated,
I have to look,

306
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I have to count,
I have to check.

307
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Has it got -- say it's repeated
three times.

308
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So what's a possibility for the
-- so here is the,

309
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
here is the repeated
possibility.

310
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And, and let me emphasize the
conclusion.

311
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That if I have repeated
eigenvalues, I may or may not,

312
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I may or may not have,
have n independent

313
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
eigenvectors.

314
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I might.

315
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I, I, you know,
this isn't a completely

316
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
negative case.

317
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
The identity matrix -- suppose
I take the ten by ten identity

318
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
matrix.

319
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What are the eigenvalues of
that

320
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
matrix?

321
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So just, just take the easiest
matrix, the identity.

322
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
If I look for its eigenvalues,
they're all ones.

323
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So that eigenvalue one is
repeated ten times.

324
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But there's no shortage of
eigenvectors for the identity

325
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
matrix.

326
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
In fact, every vector is an
eigenvector.

327
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So I can take ten independent
vectors.

328
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Oh, well, what happens to
everything -- if A is the

329
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
identity matrix,
let's just think that one

330
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
through in our head.

331
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
If A is the identity matrix,
then it's got plenty of

332
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
eigenvectors.

333
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I choose ten independent
vectors.

334
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
They're the columns of S.

335
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And, and what do I get from S
inverse A S?

336
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I get I again,
right?

337
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
If A is the identity -- and of
course that's the correct

338
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
lambda.

339
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,890
The matrix was already
diagonal.

340
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,000
So if the matrix is already
diagonal, then the,

341
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
the lambda is the same as the
matrix.

342
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
A diagonal matrix has got its
eigenvalues sitting right there

343
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
in front of you.

344
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Now if it's triangular,
the eigenvalues are still

345
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
sitting there,
but so let's take a case where

346
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
it's triangular.

347
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Suppose A is like,
two one two zero.

348
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So there's a case that's going
to be trouble.

349
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
There's a case that's going to
be trouble.

350
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
First of all,
what are the -- I mean,

351
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
we just -- if we start with a
matrix, the first thing we do,

352
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
practically without thinking is
compute the eigenvalues and

353
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
eigenvectors.

354
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,000
OK.
So what are the eigenvalues?

355
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You can tell me right away what
they are.

356
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
They're two and two,
right.

357
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's a triangular matrix,
so when I do this determinant,

358
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
shall I do this determinant of
A minus lambda I?

359
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'll get this two minus lambda
one zero two minus lambda,

360
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
right?

361
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I take that determinant,
so I make those into vertical

362
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
bars to mean determinant.

363
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And what's the determinant?

364
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,890
It's two minus lambda squared.

365
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,000
What are the roots?

366
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Lambda equal two twice.

367
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,280
So the eigenvalues are lambda
equals two and two.

368
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,000
OK, fine.

369
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Now the next step,
find the eigenvectors.

370
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,670
So I look for eigenvectors,
and what do I find for this

371
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,000
guy?

372
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Eigenvectors for this guy,
when I subtract two minus the

373
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
identity, so A minus two I has
zeros here.

374
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And I'm looking for the null
space.

375
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
What's, what are the
eigenvectors?

376
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
They're the --
the null space of A minus

377
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,290
lambda I.

378
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:01,000
The null space is only one
dimensional.

379
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
This is a case where I don't
have enough eigenvectors.

380
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
My algebraic multiplicity is
two.

381
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I would say,
when I see, when I count how

382
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,910
often the eigenvalue is
repeated, that's

383
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,000
the algebraic multiplicity.

384
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That's the multiplicity,
how many times is it the root

385
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
of the polynomial?

386
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
My polynomial is two minus
lambda squared.

387
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It's a double root.

388
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So my algebraic multiplicity is
two.

389
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
But the geometric multiplicity,
which looks for vectors,

390
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
looks for eigenvectors,
and -- which means the null

391
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
space of this thing,
and the only eigenvector is one

392
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,000
zero.
That's in the null space.

393
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Zero one is not in the null
space.

394
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
The null space is only one
dimensional.

395
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So there's a matrix,
my -- this A or the original A,

396
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,610
that are not diagonalizable.

397
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:09,130
I can't find two independent
eigenvectors.

398
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,000
There's only one.

399
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,000
OK.
So that's the case that I'm --
that's a case that I'm not

400
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
really handling.

401
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
For example,
when I wrote down up here that

402
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
the powers went to zero if the
eigenvalues were below one,

403
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I didn't really handle that
case of repeated eigenvalues,

404
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,290
because my reasoning was based
on this formula.

405
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:42,000
And this formula is based on n
independent eigenvectors.

406
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,000
OK.
Just to say then,
there are some matrices that

407
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
we're, that, that we don't cover
through diagonalization,

408
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
but the great majority we do.

409
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,000
OK.
And we, we're always OK if we
have different distinct

410
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
eigenvalues.

411
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,320
OK, that's the,
like, the typical case.

412
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,000
Because for each eigenvalue
there's at least one

413
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
eigenvector.

414
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
The algebraic multiplicity here
is one for every eigenvalue and

415
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,180
the geometric multiplicity is
one.

416
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,000
There's one eigenvector.

417
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And they are independent.

418
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,000
OK.
OK.
Now let me come back to the
important case,

419
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
when, when we're OK.

420
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
The important case,
when we are diagonalizable.

421
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,790
Let me, look at -- so -- let me
solve

422
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,000
this equation.

423
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:59,000
The equation will be each -- I
start with some -- start with a

424
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
given vector u0.

425
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And then my equation is at
every step, I multiply what I

426
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
have by A.

427
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,000
That, that equation ought to be
simple to handle.

428
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And I'd like to be able to
solve it.

429
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
How would I find -- if I start
with a vector u0 and I multiply

430
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
by A a hundred times,
what have I got?

431
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,380
Well, I could certainly write
down a formula for the answer,

432
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,000
so what, what -- so u1 is A u0.

433
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And u2 is -- what's u2 then?
u2, I multiply -- u2 I get

434
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
from u1 by another multiplying
by A, so I've got A twice.

435
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And my formula is uk,
after k steps,

436
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,760
I've multiplied by A k times
the original u0.

437
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,000
You see what I'm doing?

438
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
The next section is going to
solve systems of differential

439
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,870
equations.

440
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:21,240
I'm going to have derivatives.

441
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,000
This section is the nice one.

442
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It solves difference equations.

443
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I would call that a difference
equation.

444
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's -- at first order,
I would call that a first-order

445
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
system, because it connects only
-- it only goes up one level.

446
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And I -- it's a system because
these are vectors and that's a

447
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
matrix.

448
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And the solution is just
that.

449
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
OK.

450
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But, that's a nice formula.

451
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
That's the, like,
the most compact formula I

452
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
could ever get.
u100 would be A to the one

453
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,860
hundred u0.

454
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,000
But how would I actually find
u100?

455
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
How would I find -- how would I
discover what u100 is?

456
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Let me,
let me show you how.

457
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Here's the idea.

458
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
If -- so to solve,
to really solve -- shall I say,

459
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
to really solve -- to really
solve it, I would take this

460
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
initial vector u0 and I would
write it as a combination of

461
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
eigenvectors.

462
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
To really solve,
write u

463
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
nought as a combination,
say certain amount of the first

464
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
eigenvector plus a certain
amount of the second eigenvector

465
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
plus a certain amount of the
last eigenvector.

466
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Now multiply by A.

467
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You want to -- you got to see
the magic of eigenvectors

468
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
working here.

469
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Multiply by A.

470
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So Au0 is
what?

471
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So A times that.

472
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
A times -- so what's A -- I can
separate it out into n separate

473
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
pieces, and that's the whole
point.

474
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
That each of those pieces is
going in its own merry way.

475
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,810
Each of those pieces is an
eigenvector, and when I multiply

476
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:39,000
by A,
what does this piece become?

477
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So that's some amount of the
first -- let's suppose the

478
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
eigenvectors are normalized to
be unit vectors.

479
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So that says what the
eigenvector is.

480
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It's a -- And I need some
multiple of it to produce u0.

481
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
OK.

482
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Now when I multiply by A,
what do I get?

483
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I get c1, which is just a
factor, times Ax1,

484
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
but Ax1 is lambda one x1.

485
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,610
When I multiply this by A,
I get c2 lambda two x2.

486
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,960
And here I get cn lambda n xn.

487
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,000
And suppose I multiply by A to
the hundredth power now.

488
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Can we, having done it,
multiplied by A,

489
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
let's multiply by A to the
hundredth.

490
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
What happens to this first term
when I multiply by A to the one

491
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
hundredth?

492
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It's got that factor lambda to
the hundredth.

493
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
That's the key.

494
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
That -- that's what I mean by
going its own merry way.

495
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It, it is pure eigenvector.

496
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It's exactly in a direction
where multiplication by A just

497
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,500
brings in a scalar factor,
lambda one.

498
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,000
So a hundred times brings in
this a hundred times.

499
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Hundred times lambda two,
hundred times lambda n.

500
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Actually, we're -- what are we
seeing here?

501
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
We're seeing,
this same, lambda capital

502
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
lambda to the hundredth as in
the, as in the diagonalization.

503
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And we're seeing the S matrix,
the, the matrix S of

504
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
eigenvectors.

505
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
That's what this has got to --
this has got to amount to.

506
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
A lambda to the hundredth
power times an S times this

507
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
vector c that's telling us how
much of each one is in the

508
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
original thing.

509
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So if, if I had to really find
the hundredth power,

510
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I would take u0,
I would expand it as a

511
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
combination of eigenvectors --
this is really S,

512
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
the eigenvector matrix,
times c, the,

513
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
the coefficient vector.

514
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And then I would immediately
then, by inserting these

515
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
hundredth powers of eigenvalues,
I'd have the answer.

516
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,380
So -- huh, there must be -- oh,
let's see, OK.

517
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,000
It's -- so, yeah.

518
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So if u100 is A to the
hundredth times u0,

519
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and u0 is S c -- then you see
this formula is just this

520
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,000
formula, which is the way I
would actually get hold of this,

521
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
of this u100,
which is -- let me put it here.

522
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,000
u100.
The way
I would actually get hold of

523
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
that, see what,
what the solution is after a

524
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,430
hundred steps,
would be -- expand the initial

525
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:08,000
vector into eigenvectors and let
each eigenvector go its own way,

526
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
multiplying by a hundred at --
by lambda at every step,

527
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
and therefore by lambda to the
hundredth

528
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
power after a hundred steps.

529
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Can I do an example?

530
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,780
So that's the formulas.

531
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,000
Now let me take an example.

532
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'll use the Fibonacci sequence
as an example.

533
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So, so Fibonacci example.

534
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You remember the Fibonacci
numbers?

535
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,000
If we start with one and one as
F0 -- oh, I think I start with

536
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
zero, maybe.

537
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Let zero and one be the first
ones.

538
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,850
So there's F0 and F1,
the first two Fibonacci

539
00:34:58,850 --> 00:34:59,000
numbers.

540
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Then what's the rule for
Fibonacci numbers?

541
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Ah, they're the sum.

542
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The next one is the sum of
those,

543
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
so it's one.

544
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
The next one is the sum of
those, so it's two.

545
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
The next one is the sum of
those, so it's three.

546
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Well, it looks like one two
three four five,

547
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
but somehow it's not going to
do that way.

548
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,480
The next one is five,
right.

549
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,000
Two and three makes five.

550
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
The next one is eight.

551
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
The next one is thirteen.

552
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And the one hundredth Fibonacci
number is what?

553
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,770
That's my question.

554
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:44,000
How could I get a formula for
the hundredth number?

555
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And, for example,
how could I answer the

556
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
question, how fast are they
growing?

557
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
How fast are those Fibonacci
numbers

558
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,200
growing?

559
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,000
They're certainly growing.

560
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's not a stable case.

561
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Whatever the eigenvalues of
whatever matrix it is,

562
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
they're not smaller than one.

563
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
These numbers are growing.

564
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,830
But how fast are they growing?

565
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,000
The answer lies in the
eigenvalue.

566
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So I've got to find the matrix,
so let me write down the

567
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Fibonacci rule.

568
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
F(k+2) = F(k+1)+F k,
right?

569
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Now that's not in my -- I want
to write that as uk plus one and

570
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Auk.

571
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,610
But right now what I've got is
a single equation,

572
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:41,000
not a system,
and it's second-order.

573
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:49,120
It's like having a second-order
differential equation with

574
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,000
second derivatives.

575
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I want to get first
derivatives.

576
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Here I want to get first
differences.

577
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So the way, the way to do it is
to introduce uk will be a vector

578
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
-- see, a small trick.

579
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Let uk be a vector,
F(k+1)

580
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
and Fk.

581
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So I'm going to get a two by
two system, first order,

582
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
instead of a one -- instead of
a scalar system,

583
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,140
second order,
by a simple trick.

584
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm just going to add in an
equation F(k+1) equals F(k+1).

585
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
That will be my second
equation.

586
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Then this is my system,
this is my unknown,

587
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,400
and what's my one step
equation?

588
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,450
So, so now u(k+1),
that's -- so u(k+1) is the left

589
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:51,000
side, and what have I got here
on the right side?

590
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I've got some matrix
multiplying uk.

591
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Can you, do -- can you see that
all right?

592
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
if you can see it,
then you can tell me what the

593
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
matrix is.

594
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Do you see that I'm taking my
system here.

595
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I artificially made it into a
system.

596
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I artificially made the unknown
into a vector.

597
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And now I'm ready to look at
and see what the matrix

598
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,000
is.
So do you see the left side,
u(k+1) is F(k+2) F(k+1),

599
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
that's just what I want.

600
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
On the right side,
this remember,

601
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
this uk here -- let me for the
moment put it as F(k+1) Fk.

602
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So what's the matrix?

603
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Well, that has a one and a one,
and that has a one and a zero.

604
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
There's the matrix.

605
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Do you see that that gives me
the right-hand side?

606
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So there's the matrix A.

607
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And this is our friend uk.

608
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So we've got -- so that simple
trick -- changed the

609
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
second-order scalar problem to a
first-order system.

610
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,300
Two b- u- with two unknowns.

611
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,000
With
a matrix.

612
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And now what do I do?

613
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Well, before I even think,
I find its eigenvalues and

614
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
eigenvectors.

615
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So what are the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of that matrix?

616
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Let's see.

617
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I always -- first let me just,
like, think for a minute.

618
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It's two by two,
so this shouldn't be impossible

619
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
to do.

620
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Let's do it.

621
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
OK.

622
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So my matrix,
again, is one one one zero.

623
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's symmetric,
by the way.

624
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,590
So what I will eventually know
about symmetric matrices is that

625
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:59,670
the eigenvalues will come out
real.

626
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,000
I won't get any complex numbers
here.

627
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And the eigenvectors,
once I get those,

628
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
actually will be orthogonal.

629
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
But two by two,
I'm more interested in what the

630
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
actual numbers are.

631
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,440
What do I know about the two
numbers?

632
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,000
Well, should do you want me to
find this determinant of A minus

633
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,000
lambda I?
Sure.

634
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
So it's the determinant of one
minus lambda one one zero,

635
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,000
right?
Minus lambda,
yes.

636
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,000
God.
OK.

637
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,320
OK.

638
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,000
There'll be two eigenvalues.

639
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,000
What will -- tell me again what
I know about the two eigenvalues

640
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
before I go any further.

641
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Tell me something about these
two eigenvalues.

642
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
What do they add up to?

643
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Lambda one plus lambda two is?

644
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Is the same as the trace down
the diagonal of the matrix.

645
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
One and zero is one.

646
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So lambda one plus lambda two
should come out to be one.

647
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And lambda one times lambda one
times lambda two should come out

648
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
to be the determinant,
which is minus one.

649
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So I'm
expecting the eigenvalues to

650
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
add to one and to multiply to
minus one.

651
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
But let's just see it happen
here.

652
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
If I multiply this out,
I get -- that times that'll be

653
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
a lambda squared minus lambda
minus one.

654
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Good.
Lambda squared minus lambda
minus one.

655
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Actually, I -- you see
the b- compare that with the

656
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
original equation that I started
with.

657
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
F(k+2) - F(k+1)-Fk is zero.

658
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:00,000
The recursion that -- that the
Fibonacci numbers satisfy is

659
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,000
somehow showing up directly here
for the eigenvalues when we set

660
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
that to zero.

661
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,000
WK.
Let's solve.

662
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Well, I would like to be able
to factor that,

663
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
that quadratic,
but I'm better off to use the

664
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,810
quadratic formula.

665
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:25,000
Lambda is -- let's see.

666
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Minus b is one plus or minus
the square root of b squared,

667
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
which is one,
minus four times that times

668
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
that, which is
plus four, over two.

669
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
So that's the square root of
five.

670
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So the eigenvalues are lambda
one is one half of one plus

671
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
square root of five,
and lambda two is one half of

672
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
one minus square root of five.

673
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And sure enough,
they -- those add up to one and

674
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
they multiply to give minus one.

675
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,000
OK.
Those are the two eigenvalues.

676
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
How -- what are those numbers
approximately?

677
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Square root of five,
well, it's more than two but

678
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
less than three.

679
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Hmm.
It'd be nice to know these
numbers.

680
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:30,000
I think, I think that -- so
that number comes out bigger

681
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,360
than
one, right?

682
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,000
That's right.

683
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
This number comes out bigger
than one.

684
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It's about one point six one
eight or something.

685
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Not exactly,
but.

686
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And suppose it's one point six.

687
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Just, like, I think so.

688
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Then what's lambda two?

689
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Is, is lambda two positive or
negative?

690
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Negative, right,
because I'm -- it's,

691
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
obviously negative,
and I knew that the -- so it's

692
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
minus -- and they add up to one,
so minus point six one eight,

693
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I guess.

694
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,000
OK.
A- and some more.

695
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Those are the two eigenvalues.

696
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
One eigenvalue bigger than one,
one eigenvalue smaller than

697
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,000
one.
Actually, that's a great
situation to be in.

698
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Of course, the eigenvalues are
different, so there's no doubt

699
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
whatever -- is this matrix
diagonalizable?

700
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Is this matrix diagonalizable,
that original matrix A?

701
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Sure.

702
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
We've got two distinct
eigenvalues and we can find the

703
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
eigenvectors in
a moment.

704
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
But they'll be independent,
we'll be diagonalizable.

705
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And now, you,
you can already answer my very

706
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,940
first question.

707
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:01,000
How fast are those Fibonacci
numbers increasing?

708
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
How -- those -- they're
increasing,

709
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,000
right?
They're not doubling at every
step.

710
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Let me -- let's look again at
these numbers.

711
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Five, eight,
thirteen, it's not obvious.

712
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
The next one would be
twenty-one, thirty-four.

713
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,960
So to get some idea of what F
one hundred is,

714
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:30,000
can you give me any -- I mean
the crucial number -- so it --

715
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,000
these -- it's approximately --
what's controlling the growth of

716
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
these Fibonacci numbers?

717
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It's the eigenvalues.

718
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And which eigenvalue is
controlling that growth?

719
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
The big one.

720
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So F100 will be approximately
some constant,

721
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
c1 I guess, times this lambda
one, this one plus square root

722
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
of five over two,
to the hundredth power.

723
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And the two hundredth F -- in
other words, the eigenvalue --

724
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
the Fibonacci numbers are
growing by about that factor.

725
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Do you see that we,
we've got precise information

726
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
about the, about the Fibonacci
numbers out of the eigenvalues?

727
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,000
OK.
And again, why is that true?

728
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Let me go over to this board
and s- show what I'm doing here.

729
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
The --
the original initial value is

730
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
some combination of
eigenvectors.

731
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And then when we start -- when
we start going out the theories

732
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
of Fibonacci numbers,
when we start multiplying by A

733
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
a hundred times,
it's this lambda one to the

734
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
hundredth.

735
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
This term is,
is the one that's taking over.

736
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It's -- I mean,
that's big, like one point six

737
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
to the hundredth power.

738
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
The second term is practically
nothing, right?

739
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
The point six,
or minus point six,

740
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
to the hundredth power is an
extremely small,

741
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
extremely small number.

742
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
So this is -- there're only two
terms, because we're two by two.

743
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,710
This number is -- this piece of
it is there, but it's,

744
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:23,000
it's disappearing,
where this piece is there and

745
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
it's growing and controlling
everything.

746
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
So, so really the -- we're
doing, like, problems that are

747
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,030
evolving.

748
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:37,000
We're doing dynamic u- instead
of Ax=b, that's a static

749
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
problem.

750
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
We're now we're doing dynamics.

751
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
A, A squared,
A cubed, things are evolving in

752
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,000
time.
And the eigenvalues are the
crucial, numbers.

753
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,000
OK.
I guess to complete this,
I better write down the

754
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,000
eigenvectors.

755
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So we should complete the,
the whole process by finding

756
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
the eigenvectors.

757
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
OK, well, I have to -- up in
the corner, then,

758
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I have to look at A minus
lambda I.

759
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,000
So A minus lambda I is this one
minus lambda one one and minus

760
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,940
lambda.

761
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,000
And now can we spot an
eigenvector out of that?

762
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
That's, that's,
for these two lambdas,

763
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
this matrix is singular.

764
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I guess the eigenvector -- two
by two ought to be,

765
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I mean, easy.

766
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,000
So if I know that this matrix
is singular, then u- seems to me

767
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
the eigenvector has to be
lambda and one,

768
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
because that multiplication
will give me the zero.

769
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And this multiplication gives
me -- better give me also zero.

770
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Do you see why it does?

771
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
This is the minus lambda
squared plus lambda plus one.

772
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
It's the thing that's zero
because these lambdas

773
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
are special.

774
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
There's the eigenvector.
x1 is lambda one one,

775
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
and x2 is lambda two one.

776
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I did that as a little trick
that was available in the two by

777
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
two case.

778
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:23,000
So now I finally have to -- oh,
I have to take the initial u0

779
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:23,000
now.
So to complete this example
entirely, I have to say,

780
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:34,000
OK, what was u0?
u0 was F1 F0.

781
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:42,000
So u0, the starting vector is
F1 F0, and those were one and

782
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,000
zero.
So I have to use that vector.

783
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So I have to look for,
for a multiple of the first

784
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:00,000
eigenvector and the second to
produce u0, the one zero

785
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
vector.
This is what will find c1 and
c2, and then I'm done.

786
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Do you -- so let me instead of,
in the last five seconds,

787
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,000
grinding out a formula,
let me repeat the idea.

788
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Because I'd really -- it's the
idea that's central.

789
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
When things are evolving in
time -- let me come back to this

790
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
board, because the ideas are
here.

791
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
When things are evolving in
time by a first-order system,

792
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
starting from an original u0,
the key is find the eigenvalues

793
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
and eigenvectors of A.

794
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
That will tell -- those
eigenvectors -- the eigenvalues

795
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
will already tell you what's
happening.

796
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Is the solution blowing up,
is it going to zero,

797
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
what's it doing.

798
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And then to,
to find out exactly a formula,

799
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
you have to take your u0 and
write it as a combination of

800
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,930
eigenvectors and then follow
each eigenvector separately.

801
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:14,000
And that's really what this
formula, the formula for,

802
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
-- that's what the formula for
A to the K is doing.

803
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So remember that formula for A
to the K is S lambda to the K S

804
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
inverse.

805
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,000
OK.
That's,
that's difference equations.

806
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And you just have to -- so the,
the homework will give some

807
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
examples, different from
Fibonacci, to follow through.

808
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And next time will be
differential equations.

809
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Thanks.
