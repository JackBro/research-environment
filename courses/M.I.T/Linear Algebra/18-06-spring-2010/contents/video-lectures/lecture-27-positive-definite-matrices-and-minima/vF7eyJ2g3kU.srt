1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
OK, this is the lecture on
positive definite matrices.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I made a start on those briefly
in a previous lecture.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
One point I wanted to make was
the way that this topic brings

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the whole course together,
pivots, determinants,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
eigenvalues,
and something new- four plot

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
instability and then something
new

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
in this expression,
x transpose Ax,

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
actually that's the guy to
watch in this lecture.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So, so the topic is positive
definite matrix,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and what's my goal?

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
First, first goal is,
how can I tell if a matrix is

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
positive definite?

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So I would like to have tests
to see

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
if you give me a,
a five by five matrix,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
how do I tell if it's positive
definite?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
More important is,
what does it mean?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Why are we so interested in
this property of positive

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
definiteness?

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And then, at the end comes some
geometry.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ellipses are connected
with positive definite things.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hyperbolas are not connected
with positive definite things,

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
so we- it's this,
we, there's a geometry too,

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
but mostly it's linear algebra
and -- this application of how

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
do you recognize 'em when you
have a minim is pretty neat.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,330
OK.

26
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm gonna begin with two by
two.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
All matrices are symmetric,
right?

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's understood;
the matrix is symmetric,

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
now my question is,
is it positive definite?

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Now, here are some -- each one
of these is a complete test for

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
positive definiteness.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If I know the eigenvalues,
my test is are they positive?

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Are they all positive?

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If I know these -- so,
A is really -- I look at that

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
number A, here,
as the, as the one by one

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
determinant, and here's the two
by two determinant.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So this is the determinant
test.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,110
This is the eigenvalue test,
this is the determinant test.

39
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,000
Are the determinants growing in
s- of all, of all end,

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
sort of, can I call them
leading submatrices,

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
they're the first ones the
northwest,

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Seattle submatrices coming down
from from there,

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,600
they all, all those
determinants have to be

44
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,000
positive, and then another test
is the pivots.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The pivots of a two by two
matrix are the number A for

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
sure, and, since the product is
the determinant,

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
the second pivot must be the
determinant divided by A.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And then in here is gonna come
my favorite and my new idea,

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the, the, the the one to catch,
about x transpose Ax being

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
positive.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But we'll have to look at this
guy.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This gets, like a star,
because for most,

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
presentations,
the definition of positive

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
definiteness would be this
number four and these numbers

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
one two three would be test
four.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
OK.
Maybe I'll tuck this,
where, you know,

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
OK.
So I'll have to look at this x
transpose Ax.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Can you, can we just be sure,
how do we know that the

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
eigenvalue
test and the determinant test,

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
pick out the same matrices,
and let me, let's just do a few

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
examples.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Some examples.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let me pick the matrix two,
six, six, tell me,

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,820
what number do I have to put
there for the matrix to be

65
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,000
positive definite?

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Tell me a sufficiently large
number that would make it

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
positive definite?

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's just practice with these
conditions in the two by two

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
case.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Now, when I ask you that,
you don't wanna find the

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
eigenvalues, you would use the
determinant test for that,

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
so,
the first or the pivot test,

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
that, that guy is certainly
positive, that had to happen,

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and it's OK.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How large a number here -- the
number had better be more than

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
what?
More than eighteen,
right, because if it's eight --

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
no.
More than what?

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Nineteen, is it?

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
If I have a nineteen here,
is that positive definite?

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I get thirty eight minus thirty
six, that's OK.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If I had an eighteen,
let me play it really close.

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If I have an eighteen there,
then I positive definite?

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,480
Not quite.

84
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:51,000
I would call this guy positive,
so it's useful just to see that

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
this the borderline.

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That matrix is on the
borderline, I would call that

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
matrix positive semi-definite.

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And what are the eigenvalues of
that matrix, just since we're

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
given eigenvalues of two by
twos, when it's semi-definite,

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
but not definite,
then the -- I'm squeezing this

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
eigenvalue test down,
-- what's the eigenvalue that I

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
know this matrix has?

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What kind of a matrix have I
got here?

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's a singular matrix,
one of its eigenvalues is zero.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That has an eigenvalue zero,
and the other eigenvalue is --

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
from the trace,
twenty.

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
OK.
So that, that matrix has
eigenvalues greater than or

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
equal to zero,
and it's that "equal to" that

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
brought this word
"semi-definite" in.

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,470
And, the what are the pivots of
that matrix?

101
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,000
So the pivots,
so the eigenvalues are zero and

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
twenty, the pivots are,
well, the pivot is two,

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and what's the next pivot?

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
There isn't one.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We got a singular matrix here,
it'll only have one pivot.

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You see that that's a rank one
matrix, two six is a -- six

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
eighteen is a multiple of two
six, the matrix is singular it

108
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,210
only has one pivot,
so the pivot test doesn't quite

109
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:38,000
pass.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The -- let me do the x
transpose Ax.

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Now this is -- the novelty now.

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
OK.
What I looking at when I
look at this new combination,

113
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,000
x transpose Ax.
x is any vector now,

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
so lemme compute,
so any vector,

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
lemme call its components x1
and x2, so that's x.

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And I put in here A.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,370
Let's, let's use this example
two six, six eighteen,

118
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,000
and here's x transposed,
so x1 x2.

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We're back to real matrices,
after that last lecture that-

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
that said what to do in the
complex case,

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
let's come back to real
matrices.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So here's x transpose Ax,
and what I'm interested in is,

123
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
what do I get if I multiply
those together?

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I get some function of x1 and
x2, and what is it?

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,620
Let's see, if I do this
multiplication,

126
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,000
so I do it, lemme,
just, I'll just do it slowly,

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
x1, x2, if I multiply that
matrix, this is 2x1,

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and 6x2s, and the next row is
6x1s and 18x2s,

129
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and now I do this final step
and what do I have?

130
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,920
I've got 2x1 squareds,
got 2X1 squareds is coming from

131
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,000
this two, I've got this one
gives me eighteen,

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
well, shall I do the ones in
the middle?

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
How many x1 x2s do I have?

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's see,
x1 times that 6x2 would be six

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
of 'em, and then x2 times this
one will be six more,

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I get twelve.

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So, in here is going,
this is the number a,

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
this is the number 2b,
and in here is -- x2 times

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
eighteen x2 will be eighteen x2
squareds and this

140
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
is the number c.

141
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So it's ax1 -- it's like ax
squared.

142
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,230
2bxy and cy squared.

143
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:07,000
For my first point that I
wanted to make by just doing out

144
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
a multiplication is,
that is as soon as you give me

145
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
the matrix, as soon as you give
me the matrix,

146
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I can --
those are the numbers that

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
appear in -- I'll call this
thing a quadratic,

148
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
you see, it's not linear
anymore.

149
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Ax is linear,
but now I've got an x transpose

150
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
coming in, I'm up to degree two,
up to degree two,

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
maybe quadratic is the -- use
the word.

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
A quadratic form.

153
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's purely degree two,
there's no linear part,

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
there's no constant part,
there certainly no cubes or

155
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
fourth powers,
it's all second degree.

156
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And my question is -- is that
quantity positive or not?

157
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's -- for every x1 and x2,
that is my new definition --

158
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that's my definition of a
positive definite matrix.

159
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
If this quantity is positive,
if, if, if, it's positive for

160
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
all x's and y's,
all x1 x2s, then I call them --

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
then that's the matrix is
positive definite.

162
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Now, is this guy passing our
test?

163
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Well we have,
we anticipated the answer here

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,870
by, by asking first about
eigenvalues and pivots,

165
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,970
and what happened?

166
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,000
It failed.

167
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It barely failed.

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
If I had made this eighteen
down to a seven,

169
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
it would've totally failed.

170
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I do that with the eraser,
and then I'll put back

171
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
eighteen, because,
seven is such a total disaster,

172
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
but if -- I'll keep seven for a
second.

173
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Is that thing in any way
positive definite?

174
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
No, absolutely not.

175
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't know its eigenvalues,
but I know for sure one of them

176
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,980
is negative.

177
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,000
Its pivots are two and then the
next pivot would be the

178
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
determinant over two,
and the determinant is -- what,

179
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
what's the determinant of this
thing?

180
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Fourteen minus thirty six,
I've got a determinant minus

181
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
twenty two.

182
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The next pivot will be -- the
pivots

183
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
now, of this thing are two and
minus eleven or something.

184
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Their product being minus
twenty two the determinant.

185
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This thing is not positive
definite.

186
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What would be -- let me look at
the x transpose Ax for this guy.

187
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What's -- if I do out this
multiplication,

188
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,500
this eighteen is temporarily
changing to a seven.

189
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,000
This eighteen is temporarily
changing to a seven,

190
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and I know that there's some
numbers x1 and x2 for which that

191
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
thing, that function,
is negative.

192
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And I'm desperately trying to
think what they are.

193
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Maybe you can see.

194
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Can you tell me a value of x1
and x2 that makes this quantity

195
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
negative?

196
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh, maybe one and minus one?

197
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yes, that's -- in this case,
that, will work,

198
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
right, if I took x1 to be one,
and x2 to be minus one,

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
then I always get something
positive, the two,

200
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and the seven minus one
squared, but this would be

201
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
minus twelve and the whole thing
would be negative;

202
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I would have two minus twelve
plus seven, a negative.

203
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If I drew the graph,
can I get the little picture in

204
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,000
here?
If I draw the graph of this
thing?

205
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So, graphs, of the function
f(x,y),

206
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
or f(x), so I say here f(x,y)
equal this -- x transpose Ax,

207
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
this, this this ax squared,
2bxy, and cy squared.

208
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And, let's take the example,
with these numbers.

209
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
OK, so here's the x axis,
here's the y axis,

210
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and here's -- up is the
function.

211
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,180
z, if you like,
or f.

212
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,000
I apologize,
and let me, just once in my

213
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
life here, put an arrow over
these, these,

214
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
axes so you see them.

215
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's the vector and I just,
see, instead of x1 and x2,

216
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I made them x- the components x
and y.

217
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,000
OK.
So, so, what's a graph of 2x
squared,

218
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
twelve xy, and seven y squared?

219
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'd like to see -- I not the
greatest artist,

220
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
but let's -- tell me something
about this graph of this

221
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,870
function.

222
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:44,000
Whoa, tell me one point that it
goes through.

223
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The origin.

224
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Right?

225
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Even this artist can get this
thing

226
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
to go through the origin,
when these are zero,

227
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I, I certainly get zero.

228
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,000
OK.
Some more points.

229
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
If x is one and y is zero,
then I'm going upwards,

230
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
so I'm going up this way,
and I'm, I'm going up,

231
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
like, two x squared in that
direction.

232
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So -- that's meant to be a
parabola.

233
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And, suppose x stays zero and y
increases.

234
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Well, y could be positive or
negative; it's seven y squared.

235
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,420
Is this function going upward?

236
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,000
In the x direction it's going
upward, and in the y direction

237
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
it's going upwards,
and if x equals y then the

238
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
forty-five degree direction is
certainly going upwards;

239
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
because then we'd have what,
about, everything would be

240
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
positive, but what?

241
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
This function -- what's the
graph of this function?

242
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Look like?

243
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Tell me the word that
describes the graph of this

244
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
function.

245
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This is the non-positive
definite here,

246
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
everybody's with me here,
for some reason got started in

247
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
a negative direction,
your case that isn't positive

248
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
definite.

249
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And what's the graph look like
that goes up,

250
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
but does it -- do we have a
minimum here,

251
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
does it go from,
from the origin?

252
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,579
Completely?

253
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,000
No, because we just checked
that this thing failed.

254
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It failed along the direction
when x was minus y -- we have a

255
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
saddle point,
let me put myself,

256
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
let me, to the least,
tell you the word.

257
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
This thing, goes up in some
directions, but down in other

258
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:55,000
directions, and if we actually
knew what a saddle looked like

259
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
or thinks saddles do that -- the
way your legs go is,

260
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
like, down, up,
the way,

261
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
you, looking like,
forward, and,

262
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
the, and drawing the thing is
even worse than describing --

263
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm just going to say in some
directions we go up and in other

264
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
directions, there is,
a saddle -- Now I'm sorry I put

265
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
that on the front board,
you have no way to cover it,

266
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
but it's a saddle.

267
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,000
OK.
And, and this is a saddle
point, it's the,

268
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,000
it's the point that's at the
maximum in some directions and

269
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
at the minimum in other
directions.

270
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And actually,
the perfect directions to look

271
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
are the eigenvector directions.

272
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We'll see that.

273
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So this is,
not a positive definite matrix.

274
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,000
OK.
Now I'm coming back to this
example, getting rid of this

275
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
seven, let's move it up to
twenty.

276
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Let's, let's let's make the
thing really positive definite.

277
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,000
OK.
So this is, this number's now
twenty.

278
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
c is now twenty.

279
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
OK.

280
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Now that passes the test,
which I haven't proved,

281
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
of course, it passes the test
for positive pivots.

282
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It passes the test for positive
eigenvalues.

283
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
How can you tell that the
eigenvalues of that matrix are

284
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
positive without actually
finding them?

285
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Of course,
two by two I could find them,

286
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
but can you see -- how do I
know they're positive?

287
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I know that their product is --
I know that lambda one times

288
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
lambda two is positive,
why?

289
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Because that's the determinant,
right, lambda one times lambda

290
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
two is the determinant,
which is forty minus thirty-six

291
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
is
four.

292
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So the determinant is four.

293
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And the trace,
the sum down the diagonal,

294
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,440
is twenty-two.

295
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,000
So, they multiply to give four.

296
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So that leaves the possibility
they're either both positive or

297
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
both negative.

298
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,080
But if they're both negative,
the trace couldn't be

299
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,000
twenty-two.

300
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So they're both positive.

301
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So both of the eigenvalues that
are positive,

302
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,730
both of the pivots are positive
-- the determinants are

303
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,000
positive, and I believe that
this function is positive

304
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
everywhere except at zero,
zero, of course.

305
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
When I write down this
condition,

306
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So I believe that x transposed,
let me copy,

307
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
x transpose Ax is positive,
except, of course,

308
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
at the minimum point,
at zero, of course,

309
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I don't expect miracles.

310
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So what does its graph look
like, and how do I check,

311
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and how do I check that this
really is positive?

312
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So we take it's graph for a
minute.

313
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What would be the graph of that
function -- it does not have a

314
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
saddle point.

315
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Let me -- I'll raise the board,
here, and stay with this

316
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
example for a while.

317
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So I want to do the graph of --
here's my function,

318
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
two x squared,
twelve xy-s,

319
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,690
that could be positive or
negative, and twenty y squared.

320
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,620
But my point is,
so you're seeing the underlying

321
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,000
point is, that,
the things are positive

322
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
definite when in some way,
these, these pure squares,

323
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
squares we know to be positive,
and when those kind of

324
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
overwhelm this guy,
who could be m- positive or

325
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
negative,
because some like or have same

326
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
or have same or different signs,
when these are big enough they

327
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
overwhelm this guy and make the
total thing positive,

328
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and what would the graph now
look like?

329
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Let me draw the x - well,
let me draw the x direction,

330
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
the y direction,
and the origin,

331
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
at zero, zero,
I'm there, where do I go as I

332
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
move away from the origin?

333
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Where do I go as I move away
from the origin?

334
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm sure that I go up.

335
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The origin, the center point
here, is a minim because this

336
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
thing I believe,
and we better see why,

337
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
it's, the graph is like a bowl,
the

338
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
graph is like a bowl shape,
it's -- here's the minimum.

339
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And because we've got a pure
quadratic, we know it sits at

340
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
the origin, we know it's tangent
plane, the first derivatives are

341
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
zero, so, we know,
first derivatives,

342
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,000
First derivatives are all zero,
but that's not enough for a

343
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
minimum.

344
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's first derivatives were
zero here.

345
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So, the partial derivatives,
the first derivatives,

346
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
are zero.

347
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Again, because first
derivatives are gonna have an x

348
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
or an a y, or a y in them,
they'll be zero at the origin.

349
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's the second derivatives
that

350
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
control everything.

351
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's the second derivatives
that this matrix is telling us,

352
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and somehow -- here's my point.

353
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You remember in Calculus,
how did you decide on a

354
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
minimum?

355
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
First requirement was,
that the derivative had to be

356
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,000
zero.
But then you didn't know if you
had

357
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
a minimum or a maximum.

358
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
To know that you had a minimum,
you had to look at the second

359
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,670
derivative.

360
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:34,000
The second derivative had to be
positive, the slope had to be

361
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
increasing as you went through
the minimum point.

362
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The curvature had to go
upwards, and that's what we're

363
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,100
doing now in
two dimensions,

364
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,000
and in n dimensions.

365
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So we're doing what we did in
Calculus.

366
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Second derivative positive,
m- will now become that the

367
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
matrix of second derivatives is
positive definite.

368
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Can I just -- like a
translation of -- this is how

369
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,520
minimum are coming in,
ithe beginning of Calculus --

370
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:19,000
we had a minimum was associated
with second derivative,

371
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
being positive.

372
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And first derivative zero,
of course.

373
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Derivative, first derivative,
but it was the second

374
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
derivative that told us we had a
minimum.

375
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And now, in 18.06,
in linear algebra,

376
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
we'll have a minim for our
function now,

377
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
our function will have,
for your function be a function

378
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
not of just x but several
variables, the way functions

379
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
really are in real life,
the minimum will be when the

380
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,000
matrix of second derivatives,
the matrix here was one by one,

381
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,830
there was just one second
derivative, now we've got lots.

382
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,000
Is positive definite.

383
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,490
So positive for a number
translates into positive

384
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,000
definite for a matrix.

385
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,040
And it this brings everything
you check pivots,

386
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:39,480
you check determinants,
you check all your values,

387
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,000
or you check this minimum
stuff.

388
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,000
OK.
Let me come back to this graph.

389
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That graph goes upwards.

390
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And I'll have to see why.

391
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,810
How do I know that this,
that this function is always

392
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,000
positive?

393
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Can you look at that and tell
that it's always positive?

394
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Maybe two by two,
you could feel pretty sure,

395
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,020
but what's the good way to show
that this thing is always

396
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,000
positive?

397
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
If we can express it,
as, in terms of squares,

398
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
because that's what we know for
any x and y, whatever,

399
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
if we're squaring something we
certainly are not negative.

400
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So I believe that this
expression, this function,

401
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,530
could be written as a sum of
squares.

402
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:39,000
Can you tell me -- see,
because all the problems,

403
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
the headaches are coming from
this xy term.

404
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
If we can get expressions -- if
we can get that inside a square,

405
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
so actually,
what we're doing is something

406
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
called, that you've seen called
completing the square.

407
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Let me start the
square and you complete it.

408
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
OK, I think we have two of x
plus, now I don't remember how

409
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
many y-s we need,
but you'll figure it out,

410
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,410
squared.

411
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:18,000
How many y-s should I put in
here, to make -- what do I want

412
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
to do, the two x squared-s will
be correct, right?

413
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,500
What I want to do is put in the
right number of y-s to get

414
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,390
the twelve xy correct.

415
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,000
And what is that number of y-s?

416
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Let's see, I've got two times,
and so I really want six xy-s

417
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
to come out of here,
I think maybe if I put three

418
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
there, does that look right to
you?

419
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I have two- this is,
we can mentally,

420
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
multiply out,
that's X squared,

421
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
that's right,
that's six X Y,

422
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
times the two gives from,
right, and how many Y squareds

423
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
have I now got?

424
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
How many Y squareds have I now
got from this term?

425
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Eighteen.

426
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Eighteen was the key number,
remember?

427
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Now if I want to make it
twenty,

428
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
then I've got two left.

429
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Two y squared-s.

430
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That's completing the square,
and it's, now I can see that

431
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
that function is positive,
because it's all squares.

432
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,070
I've got two squares,
added together,

433
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,640
I couldn't go negative.

434
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,000
What if I went back to that
seven?

435
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
If instead of twenty that
number was a seven,

436
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
then what would happen?

437
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
This would still be correct,
I'd still have this square,

438
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
to get the two x squared and
the twelve xy,

439
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and I'd have eighteen y squared
and then what would I do here?

440
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'd have to remove eleven y
squared-s, right,

441
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
if I only had a seven here,
then instead of -- when I had a

442
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
twenty
I had two more to put in,

443
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
when I had an eighteen,
which was the marginal case,

444
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I had no more to put in.

445
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
When I had a seven,
which was the case below zero,

446
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,510
the indefinite case,
I had minus eleven.

447
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:28,000
OK.

448
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Now, so, you can see now,
that this thing is a bowl.

449
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's going upwards,
if I cut it at a plane,

450
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,250
z equal to one,
say, I would get,

451
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,000
I would get a curve,
what would be the equation for

452
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
that curve?

453
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
If I cut it at height one,
the equation would be this

454
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,570
thing equal to one.

455
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,000
And that curve would be an
ellipse.

456
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So actually,
already, I've blocked into the

457
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
lecture, the different pieces
that we're aiming for.

458
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
We're aiming for the tests,
which this passed;

459
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
we're aiming for the connection
to a minimum,

460
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,640
which this -- which we see in
the graph,

461
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:24,000
and if we chop it up,
if we set this thing equal to

462
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
one, if I set that thing equal
to one, that -- what that gives

463
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
me is, the cross-section.

464
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It gives me this,
this curve, and its equation is

465
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
this thing equals one,
and that's an ellipse.

466
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Whereas if I cut through a
saddle

467
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,090
point, I get a hyperbola.

468
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,000
OK.

469
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
But this minimum stuff is
really what I'm most interested

470
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,000
in.
OK.

471
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
By -- I just have to ask,
do you recognize,

472
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I mean, these numbers here,
the two that appeared outside,

473
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
the three that appeared inside,
the two that appeared there --

474
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
actually, those numbers come
from elimination.

475
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Completing the square is our
good old method of Gaussian

476
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
elimination, in expressed in
terms of these squares.

477
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
The -- let me show you what I
mean.

478
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I just think those numbers are
no accident,

479
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
If I take my matrix two,
six, six, and twenty,

480
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and I do elimination,
then the pivot is two and I

481
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
take three, what's the
multiplier?

482
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,410
How much of row one do I take
away from row two?

483
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,000
Three.

484
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So what you're seeing in this,
completing the square,

485
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
is the pivots outside and the
multiplier inside.

486
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Just do that again?

487
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
The pivot is two,
three -- three of those away

488
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
from that gives me two,
six, zero, and what's the

489
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
second pivot?

490
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Three of this away from this,
three sixes'll be eighteen,

491
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and the second pivot will also
be a

492
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,000
two.
So that's the U,
this is the A,

493
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:34,850
and of course the L was one,
zero, one, and the multiplier

494
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,340
was three.

495
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:42,000
So, completing the square is
elimination.

496
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Why I happy to see,
happy to see that coming

497
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
together?

498
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Because I know about
elimination

499
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
for m by m matrices.

500
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I just started talking about
completing the square,

501
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
here, for two by twos.

502
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
But now I see what's going on.

503
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Completing the square really
amounts to splitting this thing

504
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
into a sum of squares,
so what's the critical thing --

505
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I have a lot of squares,
and inside those squares are

506
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
multipliers but they're squares,
and the question is,

507
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,370
what's outside these squares?

508
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:36,000
When I complete the square,
what are the numbers that go

509
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,000
outside?
They're the pivots.

510
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
They're the pivots,
and that's why positive pivots

511
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
give me sum of squares.

512
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,550
Positive pivots,
those pivots are the numbers

513
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,000
that go outside the squares,
so positive pivots,

514
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
sum of squares,
everything positive,

515
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
graph goes up,
a minimum at the origin,

516
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
it's all connected together;
all connected together.

517
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And in the two by two case,
you can see those connections,

518
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
but linear algebra now can go
up to

519
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
three by three,
m by m.

520
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Let's do that next.

521
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,520
Can I just, before I leave two
by two, I've written this

522
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:26,000
expression "matrix of second
derivatives." What's the matrix

523
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
of second derivatives?

524
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
That's one second derivative
now, but if I'm in two

525
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
dimensions,
I have a two by two matrix,

526
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:44,040
it's the second x derivative,
the second x derivative goes

527
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,880
there -- shall I write it --
fxx, if you like,

528
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,000
fxx, that means the second
derivative of f in the x

529
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
direction.
fyy, second derivative in the y

530
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
direction.

531
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Those are the pure derivatives,
second derivatives.

532
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
They have to be positive.

533
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
For a minimum.

534
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
This number has to be positive
for a minimum.

535
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,750
That number has to be positive
for a minimum.

536
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,000
But, that's not enough.

537
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Those numbers have to somehow
be big enough to overcome this

538
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
cross-derivative,
Why is the matrix symmetric?

539
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Because the second derivative f
with respect to x and y is equal

540
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
to -- I can, that's the
beautiful fact about second

541
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
derivatives, is I can do those
in either order and I get the

542
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
same thing.

543
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
So this is the same as that,
and so, that's the matrix of

544
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
second derivatives.

545
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And the test is,
it has to be positive definite.

546
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,720
You might remember,
from, tucked in somewhere near

547
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,000
the end of eighteen o' two or at
least in the book,

548
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
was the condition for a
minimum, For a function of two

549
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,900
variables.

550
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,000
Let's -- when do you have a
minimum?

551
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
For a function of two
variables, believe me,

552
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
that's what Calculus is for.

553
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
The condition is first
derivatives have to be zero.

554
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And the matrix of second
derivatives has to be positive

555
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
definite.

556
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So you maybe remember there was
an fxx times an fyy

557
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
that had to be bigger than an
an fxy squared,

558
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
that's just our determinant,
two by two.

559
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But now, we now know the answer
for three by three,

560
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
m by m, because we can do
elimination by m by m matrices,

561
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
we can connect eigenvalues of m
by m matrices,

562
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:08,000
we can do sum of squares,
sum of m squares instead of

563
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,000
only two squares;
and so let's take a,

564
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:24,000
let me go over here to do a
three by three example.

565
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So, three by three example.

566
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,000
OK.
Oh, let me -- shall I use my
favorite matrix?

567
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You've seen this matrix before.

568
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Yes, let's use the good matrix,
four by one,

569
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
oops, open.

570
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Is that matrix positive
definite?

571
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,000
What's -- so I'm going to ask
questions about this matrix,

572
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
is it positive definite,
first of all?

573
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
What's the function associated
with that matrix,

574
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
what's the x transpose Ax?

575
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Is -- do we have a minimum for
that function,

576
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,000
at zero?
And then even what's the
geometry?

577
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,000
OK.
First of all,
is the matrix positive

578
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
definite, now I've given you the
numbers there so you can take

579
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
the determinants,
maybe that's the quickest,

580
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
is that what you would do
mentally,

581
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
if I give you all a matrix on a
quiz and say is it positive

582
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,020
definite or not?

583
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:46,000
I would take that determinant
and I'd give the answer two.

584
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I would take that determinant
and I would give the answer for

585
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
that two by two determinant,
I'd give the answer three,

586
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
and anybody remember the answer
for

587
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
the three by three determinant?

588
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It was four,
you remember for these special

589
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,040
matrices, when we do
determinants,

590
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,000
they went up two,
three, four,

591
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
five, six, they just went up
linearly.

592
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So that matrix has -- the
determinants are two,

593
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
three, and four.

594
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Pivots.

595
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
What are the pivots for that
matrix?

596
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'll tell you,
they're -- the first pivot is

597
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
two, the next pivot is three
over two, the next pivot is four

598
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
over three.

599
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Because, the product of the
pivots has to give me those

600
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
determinants.

601
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
The product of these two pivots
gives me that determinant;

602
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
the
product of all the pivots gives

603
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
me that determinant.

604
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
What are the eigenvalues?

605
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Oh, I don't know.

606
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:09,000
The eigenvalues I've got,
what do I have a cubic equation

607
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
-- a degree three equation?

608
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
There are three eigenvalues to
find.

609
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,000
If I believe what I've said
today, what do I know about

610
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,910
these
eigenvalues,

611
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:31,000
even though I don't know the
exact numbers.

612
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I -- I remember the numbers.

613
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Because these matrices are so
important that people figure

614
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
them.

615
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
But -- what do you believe to
be true about these three

616
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
eigenvalues -- you believe that
they are all positive.

617
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
They're all positive.

618
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I think that they are two minus
square root of two,

619
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
two, and two plus the square
root of two.

620
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I think.

621
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Let me just -- I can't write
those numbers down without

622
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
checking the simple checks,
what the first simple check is

623
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
the trace, so if I add those
numbers I

624
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
get six and if I add those
numbers I get six.

625
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
The other simple test is the
determinant, if I -- can you do

626
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
this, can you multiply those
numbers together?

627
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I guess we can multiply by two
out there.

628
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
What's two minus square root of
two times two plus square root

629
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
of
two, that'll be four minus two,

630
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,070
that'll be two,
yeah, two times two,

631
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:43,000
that's got the determinant,
right, so it's got,

632
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
it's got a chance of being
correct and I think it is.

633
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Now, what's the x transpose Ax?

634
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,070
I better give myself enough
room

635
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,000
for that.
x transpose Ax for this guy.

636
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
It's two x1 squareds,
and two x2 squareds,

637
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
and two x3 squareds.

638
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Those come from the diagonal,
those were easy.

639
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Now off the diagonal there's a
minus and a minus,

640
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
they come together there'll be
a minus two

641
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
minus two whats?

642
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Are coming from this one two
and two one position,

643
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
is the x1 x2.

644
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I'm doing mentally a
multiplication of this matrix

645
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
times a row vector on the left
times a column vector on the

646
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,900
right, and I know that these
numbers show up in the answer.

647
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:46,000
The diagonal is the perfect
square, this off diagonal is a

648
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
minus two x1 x2,
and there are no x1 x3-s,

649
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
and there're minus two x2 x3-s.

650
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,480
And I believe that that
expression is always positive.

651
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,000
I believe that that curve,
that graph, really,

652
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
of that function,
this is my function f,

653
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and I'm in more dimensions now
than I can draw,

654
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
it -- but the graph of that
function goes upwards.

655
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It's a bowl.

656
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Or maybe the right word is --
just forgot, what's a long word

657
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,870
for bowl?

658
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:38,000
Hm, maybe paraboloid,
I think, paraboloid comes in.

659
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I'll edit the tape and get that
word in.

660
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Bowl, let's say,
is, that, so that,

661
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
and if I can -- I could
complete the squares,

662
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I could write that as the sum
of three squares,

663
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
and those three squares would
get multiplied by the three

664
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
pivots.

665
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And the pivots are all
positive.

666
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So I would have positive pivots
times squares,

667
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
the net result would be a
positive function and a bowl

668
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
which goes upwards.

669
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,290
And then, finally,
if I cut -- if I slice through

670
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:21,000
this bowl, if I -- now I'm
asking you to stretch your

671
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
visualization here,
because I'm in four dimensions,

672
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I've
got x1 x2 x3 in the base,

673
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,260
and this function is z,
or f, or something.

674
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,000
And its graph is going up.

675
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
But I'm in four dimensions,
because I've got three in the

676
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
base and then the upward
direction, but now if I cut

677
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
through this four-dimensional
picture, at level one,

678
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
so, suppose I cut
through this thing at height

679
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
one.

680
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So I take all the points that
are at height one.

681
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
That gives me -- it gave me an
ellipse over there,

682
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
in that two by two case,
in this case,

683
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,000
this will be the equation of an
ellipsoid, a football in other

684
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
words.

685
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Well, not quite a football.

686
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
A lopsided football.

687
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
What would be,
can I try to describe to you

688
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,180
what the ellipsoid will look
like, this ellipsoid,

689
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,000
I'm sorry that the,
that I've ended the matrix

690
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
right -- at the point,
let's -- let me be sure you've

691
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
seen the equation.

692
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,620
Two x1 squared,
two x2 squared,

693
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:54,000
two x3
squared, minus two of the cross

694
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
parts, equal what?

695
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:04,990
That is the equation of a
football, so what do I mean by a

696
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:08,000
football or an ellipsoid?

697
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I mean that,
well, I'll draw a few.

698
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It's like that,
it's got a center,

699
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:24,000
and it's got it's got three
principal directions.

700
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
This ellipsoid.

701
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So -- you see what I'm saying,
if we have a sphere then all

702
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
directions would be the same.

703
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,000
If we had a true football,
or it's closer to a rugby ball,

704
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
really, because it's more
curved than a football,

705
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
it would have one long
direction and the other two

706
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
would be equal.

707
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
That would be like having a
matrix that had one eigenvalue

708
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
repeated.

709
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And then one other different.

710
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So this sphere comes from,
like, the identity matrix,

711
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
all eigenvalues the same.

712
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,990
Our rugby ball comes from a
case where --

713
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:17,050
three, the three,
two of the three eigenvalues

714
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:18,000
are the same.

715
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
But we know how the case where
-- the typical case,

716
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
where the three eigenvalues
were all different.

717
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
So this will have -- How do I
say it, if I look at this

718
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
ellipsoid correctly,
it'll have a major axis,

719
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
it'll have a middle axis,
and it'll have a minor axis.

720
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And those three axes will be in
the direction of the

721
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,110
eigenvectors.

722
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:51,000
And the lengths of those axes
will be determined by the

723
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
eigenvalues.

724
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I can get -- turn this all into
linear algebra,

725
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,300
because we have -- the right
thing we know about

726
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:07,000
eigenvectors and eigenvalues,
for that matrix is what?

727
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Of -- let me just tell you
that, repeat the main linear

728
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
algebra point.

729
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,500
How could we turn what I said
into algebra;

730
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,000
we would write this A as Q,
the eigenvector matrix,

731
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,360
times lambda,
the eigenvalue matrix

732
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,000
times Q transposed.

733
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
The principal axis theorem,
we'll call it,

734
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,000
now.
The eigenvectors tell us the
directions of the principal

735
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,000
axes.
The eigenvalues tell us the
lengths of those axes,

736
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,000
actually the lengths,
or the half-lengths,

737
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
or one over the eigenvalues,
it turns out.

738
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,620
And that is the matrix
factorization which is the most

739
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:58,000
important matrix factorization
in our eigenvalue material so

740
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
far.

741
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
That's diagonalization for a
symmetric matrix,

742
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
so instead of the inverse I can
write the transposed.

743
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
OK.

744
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I've -- so what I've tried
today is to tell you the --

745
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
what's going on with positive
definite matrices.

746
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Ah, you see all how all these
pieces are there and linear

747
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
algebra connects them.

748
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,000
OK.
See you on Friday.
