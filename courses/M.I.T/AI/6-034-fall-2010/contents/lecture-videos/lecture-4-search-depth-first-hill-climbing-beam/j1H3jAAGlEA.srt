00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,234

00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:10,220
PATRICK WINSTON: Today
we're going to be

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,030
talking about Search.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,220
I know you're going to
turn blue with yet

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,350
another lecture on Search.

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,270
Those of you who are taking
computer science subjects,

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,360
you've probably seen in 601.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,270
You'll see it again
as theory course.

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,570
But we're going to do it for
a little different purpose.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,480
I want you to develop some
intuition about various kinds

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,080
of Search work.

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,800
And I want to talk a little bit
about Search as a model of

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,080
what goes on in our heads.

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,630
And toward the end, if there's
time, I'd like to do a

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,660
demonstration for you of
something never before

16
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,960
demonstrated to a 603.4 class,
because it was only completed

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,600
last spring.

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,470
And some finishing touches were
added by me this morning.

19
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,450
Always dangerous, but we'll
see what happens.

20
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,430


21
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,870
There's Cambridge.

22
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,150
You all recognize
it, of course.

23
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,230


24
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,550
You might want to get from some
starting position s to

25
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,280
some goal position g.

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,490
So, you'll hire a cab and
hope for the best.

27
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:31,430
So, here's what might
happen, not too hot.

28
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,175
Let's move the starting
position over here.

29
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:41,250


30
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,245
I've had cab drivers
like this New York.

31
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:47,039


32
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,460
But it's not a very good path.

33
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,400
It's the path of a thief.

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,930
Let's change the way that the
search is done to that of a

35
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,975
beginner, an honest beginner.

36
00:01:56,975 --> 00:02:01,690


37
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,100
Not too bad.

38
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,360
Now, let's have a look at how
the Search would happen if the

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,440
cab driver was a Ph.D.
in physics

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,690
after his third post-doc.

41
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:25,800


42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,750
These are not actually
traverse.

43
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,050
These are just things that the
driver is thinking about, and

44
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,840
that is the very best of
all possible paths.

45
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,480
So, the thief does
a horrible job.

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,110
The beginner does a pretty
good job, but

47
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,960
not an optimal job.

48
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,790
This is the optimal job as
produced by the Ph.D. in

49
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,910
physics after his
third post-doc.

50
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,230
So, would you like to understand
how those all work?

51
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,480
The answer, of course, is yes.

52
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,660


53
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,070
I'm going to talk to you about
procedures that are different

54
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:05,260
from the way that you just
solved this problem.

55
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,420
I imagine that if I said to you,
please find a path for s

56
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,020
to g, you would, within
a few seconds, find

57
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,070
a pretty good path--

58
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,710
not the optimal one, but
a pretty good one--

59
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,050
using your eyes.

60
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,940
And we're not going to tell
you about how that works,

61
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,540
because we don't know
how that works.

62
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,030
But we do know that problem
solving with the eyes is an

63
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,260
important part of our
total intelligence.

64
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,260
And we'll never have a complete
theory of human

65
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,640
intelligence until we can
understand the contributions

66
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,990
of the human visual system to
solving everyday problems like

67
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:43,470
finding a pretty good
path in that map.

68
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,870
But, alas, we can't talk about
that, because we don't know

69
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,100
how to do it.

70
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,820
We're working on it.

71
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,450
But we don't know
how to do it.

72
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,880
So, I'm not going to use
Cambridge in my illustrations.

73
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,860
There's too much there to
work through in an hour.

74
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,620
So, we're going to use this map
over here which has been

75
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,850
designed to illustrate a
few important points.

76
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,520
You, too, can find a path
through that graph pretty

77
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,570
easily with your eyes.

78
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,320
Our programs don't have eyes,
and they don't have visually

79
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,280
grounded algorithms, so they're
going to have to do

80
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,720
something else.

81
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,180
And the very first kind of
search we want to talk about

82
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,980
is called the British
Museum approach.

83
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,100
This is a slur against at least
the British Museum, if

84
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,400
not the entire nation, because
the way you do a British

85
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,230
Museum search is you find
every possible path.

86
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,310
So, it'll be helpful to have a
diagram of all possible paths

87
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,409
on the board.

88
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,200
We're going to start with
a British Museum search.

89
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,930


90
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,130
From the starting position, it's
clear, you can go from my

91
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,405
s to either a or b.

92
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:52,400


93
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,600
And already there's an
important quiz point.

94
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,260
Whenever we have these kinds of
problems on a quiz, we ask

95
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,720
you to develop the tree
associated with a search in

96
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,470
lexical order.

97
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:11,600
So, the nodes there under s
are listed alphabetically,

98
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,710
just to have an orderly
way of doing it.

99
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,830
So, from a we can go
either b or d.

100
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,020


101
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,940
And another convention of the
subject, another thing you

102
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,530
have to keep in mind in quizzes,
is it we don't have

103
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,180
these searches bite
their own tail.

104
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,400
So, I could have said that
if I'm at a, I can

105
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,570
also go back to s.

106
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:40,730
But no path is ever allowed
them to bite itself, to go

107
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,190
around and enter and get
back to a place that's

108
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,580
already on the path.

109
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,750
Now if I go on to b first, that
means that from b I can

110
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,600
go to either a or c.

111
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,020
This is getting fat
pretty fast.

112
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,570
But let's see, s, a, b.

113
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,930
The only place I can go
is c and then to e.

114
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,360
s, a, d, without biting my own
tail and going back to a, the

115
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,290
only place I can go is g.

116
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:16,820
s b, a, I can only go
to d and then to g.

117
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,040
And finally, s, b, c,
I can only go to e.

118
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,190
So, that is a complete set of
paths as produced by any

119
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,720
program that you will feel you'd
like to write that finds

120
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,470
all possible paths.

121
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,780
I haven't been very precise
about how to do that, because

122
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,350
you don't have to be.

123
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,780
You can't save much work by
being clever, because you have

124
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,570
to find everything.

125
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,440
So, that's the British Museum
expansion of the tree.

126
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:57,230


127
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,409
So, what have I done?

128
00:06:58,409 --> 00:06:59,820
I've been playing around
with a map.

129
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,550
I showed you an example
of a map.

130
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,310
And pretty soon you're
going to think that

131
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,616
Search is about maps.

132
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:14,820
So, before going even another
tiny step, I want to emphasize

133
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,030
that Search is not
equal to maps.

134
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,600
Search is about choice.

135
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,690
And I happen to illustrate
these searches with maps,

136
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,390
because they are particularly
cogent.

137
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,790
But Search is not about maps.

138
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,800
It's about the choices you make
when you're trying to

139
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
make decisions.

140
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,470
These things I'm going to be
talking to you about today are

141
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,172
choices you make when
you explore the map.

142
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:39,630
You can make other kinds of
choices when you're exploring

143
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,630
other kinds of things.

144
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,500
And, in fact, at the end, if
there's time, I'll show you

145
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,130
how you do searches when you're
solving problems in a

146
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,380
humanities class.

147
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,000


148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,409
That's the British
Museum algorithm.

149
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:53,950
Search is not about maps.

150
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,240
Our first gold star idea,
Search is about choice.

151
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,660
But for our illustration,
Search is about maps.

152
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,530
So, the first kind of Search we
want to talk about that's

153
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,460
real is Depth-first Search.

154
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,412


155
00:08:10,412 --> 00:08:15,500
And the idea of Depth-first
Search is that you barrel

156
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,070
ahead in a single-minded way.

157
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,160


158
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,832
So, from s, your choices
are a or b.

159
00:08:27,832 --> 00:08:31,730
And you always go down the left
branch by convention.

160
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,350
So, from s, we go to a.

161
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,919
From a we have two choices.

162
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:46,990
We can go to either b or
d following our lexical

163
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,630
convention.

164
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,660
After that, we can go to c.

165
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,660
And after that we can go to e.

166
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,871
And too bad for us,
we're stuck.

167
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,520
What are we going to do.

168
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,790
We've got into a dead
end, all is lost.

169
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,640
But of course, all isn't lost.

170
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,180
Because we have the choice of
backing up to the place where

171
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,280
we last made a decision and
choosing another branch.

172
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,350
So, that process is called
variously back-up or

173
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,600
backtracking.

174
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,330


175
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,670
At this point, we would
say, ah, dead end.

176
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,110
The first place we find when we
back up the tree where we

177
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,070
made a choice is when we
chose b instead of d.

178
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,420
So, we go back up there and
take the other route.

179
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,060


180
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,730
s, a, d now goes to g.

181
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,220
And we're done.

182
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,220
We're going to make up a little
table here of things

183
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,880
that we can embellish our
basic searches with.

184
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,420
And one of the things we can
embellish our basic searches

185
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,680
with is this backtracking
idea.

186
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,700


187
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,410
Now, backtrack is not relevant
to the British Museum

188
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,120
algorithm, because you've
got to find everything.

189
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,000
You can't quit when you've
found one path.

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,940
But you'd always want to use
backtracking with Depth-first

191
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,140
Search, because you may plunge
on down and miss the path that

192
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,050
gets to the goal.

193
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,480
Now, you might ask me, is
backtracking, therefore,

194
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,330
always part of Depth-first
Search?

195
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,350
And you can read textbooks
that do it either way.

196
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,190
Count on it.

197
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,500
If we give you a Search problem
on a quiz, we'll tell

198
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,400
you whether or not your Search
is supposed to use

199
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,990
backtracking.

200
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,200
We consider it to be
an optional thing.

201
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,320
You'd be pretty stupid not to
use this optional thing when

202
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,925
you're doing Depth-first
Search.

203
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:44,800
But we'll separate these
ideas out and call

204
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,300
it an optional add-on.

205
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,600
so, that's Depth-first
Search, very simple.

206
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,670
Now, the natural companion to
Depth-first Search will be

207
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:02,454
Breadth-first Search,
Breadth-first.

208
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:07,640


209
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,620
And the way it works is you
build up this tree level by

210
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,160
level, and at some point, when
you scan across a level,

211
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,790
you'll find that you've
completed a path

212
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,100
that goes to the goal.

213
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:27,310
So, level by level, s can
go to either a or b.

214
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,670
a can go either to b or d.

215
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,620
And b can go to either a or c.

216
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,480
So, you see what we're doing.

217
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,030
We're going level by level.

218
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,360
And we haven't hit a level
with a goal in it yet, so

219
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,510
we've got to keep going.

220
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,800
Note that we're building up
quite a bit of stuff here,

221
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,360
quite a lot of growth in the
size of the path set that

222
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,540
we're keeping in mind.

223
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,850
At the next level, we have b
going to c, d going to g, a

224
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,030
going to d, and c going to e.

225
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,460
And now, when we scan
across, we do hit g.

226
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,530
So, we found a path with
Breadth-first Search, just as

227
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,985
we found a path with
Depth-first Search.

228
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:12,650


229
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,360
Now, you might say, well,
why didn't you just quit

230
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,420
when you hit g?

231
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,340
Implementation detail.

232
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,830
We'll talk about a sample
implementation.

233
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,990
You can write it in
any way you want.

234
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,080
But now that we know what these
searches are, let's

235
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,560
speed things up a little bit
here and do a couple searches

236
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,530
that now have names.

237
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,590
The first type will be
Depth-first, boom.

238
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:43,870
That's the one that produces
the thief path.

239
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,070
And then we can also do a
Breadth-first Search, which we

240
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,310
haven't tried yet.

241
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,350
What do you suppose is
going to happen?

242
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,030
Is it going to be fast, slow,
produce a good path,

243
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,840
produce a bad path?

244
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,095
I don't know, let's try it.

245
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:58,410
I had to speed it up, you see,
because it's doing an awful

246
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,670
lot of Search.

247
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,410
It's generating an awful
lot of paths.

248
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:08,420


249
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,280
Finally, you got a path.

250
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,030
Is it the best path?

251
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,680
I don't think so.

252
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,700
But we're not going to talk
about optimal paths today.

253
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,730
We're just going to talk
about pretty good

254
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,330
paths, heuristic paths.

255
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,545
Let's move the starting position
here in the middle.

256
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:25,050
Do you think Breadth-first
Search is going to be stupid?

257
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,310
I think it's going to
be pretty stupid.

258
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,730
Let's see what happens.

259
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,840
This Search is a lot to the
left, which you would never do

260
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,795
with you eye.

261
00:13:31,795 --> 00:13:35,050
Let me slow that down just
to demonstrate it.

262
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,190
It finds a shorter path, because
it's right there in

263
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,470
the middle.

264
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,810
But it spends a lot of its time
looking off to the left.

265
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,740
It's pretty stupid.

266
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,810
But that's how it works.

267
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,760
So, now that we've got two
examples of searches on the

268
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,460
table, I'd like to just write
a little flow chart for how

269
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,800
the search might work.

270
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,710
Because if I do that, then it'll
be easier for us to see

271
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,600
what kind of small differences
there are between the

272
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,550
implementations of these
various searches.

273
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,500
So, what we're going to do is
we're going to develop a

274
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,020
waiting list, a queue, a
line, whatever you'd

275
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,180
like to call it.

276
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,380
Let's call if a queue.

277
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,590
We're going to develop a queue
of paths that are under

278
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,960
consideration.

279
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,120
So, the first step in our
algorithm will be to

280
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:26,242
initialize our queue.

281
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:29,410


282
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,550
And I think what I'll do is
I'll simulate Depth-first

283
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,780
Search on this problem
up there on the

284
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,500
left using this algorithm.

285
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,890
I need to have some way of
representing my paths.

286
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,960
And what I want to do is I'm
going to betray my heritage as

287
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,720
a list programmer, because I'm
just going to put these up as

288
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,320
if there were lisp
s-expressions.

289
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,140
To begin with, I just
have one path.

290
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,710
And it has only one
node in it, s.

291
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,400
That's the whole path.

292
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,890
The next thing I do after I
initialize the queue is I

293
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:18,415
extend first path
on the queue.

294
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:24,750


295
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,785
OK, when I extend s,
I get two paths.

296
00:15:27,785 --> 00:15:30,300


297
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:38,670
I get s goes to a, and
I get s goes to b.

298
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,460
I take the first one off
the front of the queue.

299
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,320
And I put back the two
that are produced by

300
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,070
extending that path.

301
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,130
Now, after I've extended the
first path on the queue, I

302
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:56,820
have to but those extended
paths on to the queue.

303
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,200
In here there's an explicit step
where I've checked to see

304
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,620
if that first path
is a winner.

305
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,710
If it's not, I extend it.

306
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,950
And I have to put those
paths onto the queue.

307
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,180
So, I'll say that what
I do is I end queue.

308
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:18,390


309
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,950
Now, I've done one step.

310
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,160
And let's let me do
another step.

311
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,190
I'm going to take this
first path off.

312
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,580
I'm going to extend that path.

313
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,760
And where do I put these new
paths on the queue if I'm

314
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,320
doing Depth-first Search?

315
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,390
Well, I want to work with the
path that I've just generated.

316
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:43,800
I'm taking this plunge down
deep into the search tree.

317
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,290
So, since I want to keep going
down into the stuff that I

318
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,440
just generated, where then do I
want to put these two paths?

319
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,360
At the end of the queue?

320
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,430
I don't think so, because
it'll be a long

321
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,370
time getting there.

322
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,620
I want to put them on the
front of the queue.

323
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,920


324
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:12,858
For Depth-first Search, I
want to put them on the

325
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:15,220
front of the queue.

326
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:24,510
And that's why s, a, b goes
here, and s, a, d, and then

327
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,800
that's s, b.

328
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,770


329
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,100
So, s, b is still there.

330
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,550
That's still a valid
possibility.

331
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,830
But now I've stuck two paths
in front of it, both of the

332
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,060
ones I generated by taking a
path off the front of the

333
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,310
queue, discovering that it
doesn't go to the goal,

334
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,130
extending it and putting those
back on the queue.

335
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,210
I might as well complete
this illustration here.

336
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:57,070
While I'm at it, I take the s,
a, b off, s, a, b, and I can

337
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,840
go only there to c.

338
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,332
But, of course, I keep s, a,
d and s, b on the queue.

339
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:09,170


340
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,860
Now, I take the front off the
queue again, and I get s, a,

341
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:20,501
b, c, e, and not to forget
s, a, d and s, b.

342
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:23,330


343
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,340
I take the first one
off the queue.

344
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,900
It doesn't go to the goal.

345
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,000
I try to extend it, but
there's nothing there.

346
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,080
I've reached a dead end.

347
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,670
So, in this operation, all I'm
doing is taking the front one

348
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,620
off the queue and shortening
the queue.

349
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:42,030


350
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,860
We're almost home.

351
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,870
I take s, a,d off of queue.

352
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,160
And I get s, a, d, c.

353
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,300
And, of course, I
still have s, b.

354
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:00,650
Now, the next time I visit the
situation, buried in that

355
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:04,150
first step, I discover a path
that actually does get to

356
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,920
goal, and I'm done.

357
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,810
So, each time around I
visualize the queue.

358
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,320
I check to see if I'm done.

359
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,840
If not, I take the extensions
and put them

360
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,606
somewhere on the queue.

361
00:19:17,606 --> 00:19:25,000
And then I go back in.

362
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,900
And then here there's a varied
test which checks to see if

363
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,280
we're done.

364
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,650
That's how the Depth-first
Search algorithm works.

365
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,070
And now, would we have to start
all over again if we did

366
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,780
Breadth-first Search?

367
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,310
Nope.

368
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,220
Same algorithm.

369
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,110
All the code we've got
needs one line

370
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,060
replaced, one line changed.

371
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,080
What do I have to do different
in order to get a

372
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,800
Breadth-first Search out
of this instead of

373
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,580
a Depth-first Search?

374
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,440
Tanya?

375
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,930
TANYA: Change [INAUDIBLE]
on the queue.

376
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,940
PATRICK WINSTON: And where
do I put it on the queue?

377
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,840
She says to change it.

378
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,720
TANYA: On the back?

379
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,030
PATRICK WINSTON: Put
it on the back.

380
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:14,810
So, with Breadth-first Search
all I have to do

381
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,060
is put on the back.

382
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:21,290


383
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:28,990
Now, if we were content with a
inefficient search, and didn't

384
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,350
care much about how good our
path was, we'd be done.

385
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,330
And we could go home.

386
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,690
But we are a little concerned
about the

387
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,740
efficiency of our search.

388
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,820
And we would like a
pretty good path.

389
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,630
So, we're going to have
to stick around

390
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,880
for a little while.

391
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,290


392
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,770
Now, you may have noticed, up
there in that the development

393
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:57,180
of the Breadth-first Search,
that the algorithm is

394
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,430
incredibly stupid.

395
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,300


396
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,115
Why is the algorithm
incredibly stupid?

397
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:06,000


398
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,200
Ty, what do you think?

399
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,189
TY: It can't tell whether it's
getting closer or further away

400
00:21:09,189 --> 00:21:09,540
from the goal.

401
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,090
PATRICK WINSTON: It certainly
can't tell whether it's

402
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,330
getting closer or further
away from the goal.

403
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,090
And we're going to deal
with that in a minute.

404
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,640
But it's even stupider
than that.

405
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,880


406
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,540
Why is it stupid?

407
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,474
What's your name?

408
00:21:22,474 --> 00:21:24,342
DYLAN: Dylan.

409
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:26,677
It [? hits ?] the same
nodes twice.

410
00:21:26,677 --> 00:21:30,340
PATRICK WINSTON: Dylan said it's
extending paths that go

411
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,660
to the same node
more than once.

412
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,970
Let's see what Dylan's
talking about.

413
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,410


414
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,522
Down here, it extends a.

415
00:21:42,522 --> 00:21:46,810
But it's already extended
a up there.

416
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:51,440
Down here, it extends a
path that goes to b.

417
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,900
And it's already extended
a path that goes to d.

418
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:02,170
Over here, it could extend a
path that went through c, but

419
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,800
it's already got a path
that goes through c.

420
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,450
So, all of these paths
are duplicated.

421
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,040
And we're still going
through them.

422
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,450
That's incredibly stupid.

423
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,460
What we're going to do is
we're going to amend our

424
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,750
algorithm just a little bit.

425
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,940


426
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:31,210
And we're not going to extend
the first path on the queue

427
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:49,440
unless final node never
before extended.

428
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,550


429
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,380
What we're going to do is we're
going to look to see if

430
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,780
there-- we've got this path.

431
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,930
And we're going to extend it.

432
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,190
And it's got a final note.

433
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,700
If we've ever extended a path
that goes to that final node,

434
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,580
and it was a final node on
that path, then we're not

435
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,630
going to do it again.

436
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:16,520
We got to keep a list of places
that have already been

437
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,506
the last piece of a path
that was extended.

438
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:20,830
Everybody got that?

439
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,130
It's a little awkward to say it,
because it's the last node

440
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,870
we care about.

441
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:30,640
If a path terminates in a node,
and if some other path

442
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,480
previously terminated in that
node and got extended--

443
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,570
we're not going to
do it again.

444
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,820
Because it's a waste of time.

445
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,690


446
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,260
Now, let's see if this
actually helps.

447
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:51,470


448
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,200
Now, use the extended list.

449
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:00,305
Let's see, well, gee,
we got that place

450
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:01,050
in the center there.

451
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,790
Let's just repeat the
previous search.

452
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:15,200


453
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Wow, it's taking a long time.

454
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,610
But notice it put 103 paths
back on the queue.

455
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,200
Now, let's add a filter
and try again.

456
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:39,540


457
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,640
A lot less.

458
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,950
So, let's speed this up, and
we'll start way over here.

459
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,390
You remember how tedious
that search was.

460
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:55,240
And now we'll repeat it with
this list, boom, there it is.

461
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,050
That's all because we didn't do
that silly thing of going

462
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:01,610
back through the final
node that's

463
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:04,170
already been gone through.

464
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,380
So, you would never not
want to do this.

465
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,220
We better list this
as another option.

466
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:19,846


467
00:25:19,846 --> 00:25:22,420
It doesn't help with a British
Museum algorithm, because

468
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,670
nothing helps with the British
Museum algorithm.

469
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,950
Does it help with Depth-first?

470
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,800
Yes.

471
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,350
Does it help with
Breadth-first?

472
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,680
Yes.

473
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,000
Do we do backtracking
with Breadth-first?

474
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,870
No, because backtracking
can't do us any good.

475
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:43,990
OK, we're almost, except that
search that's starting in the

476
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,090
middle is still pretty stupid.

477
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:52,200
Both the Breadth-first version
and the Depth-first version

478
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,940
are going off to the left.

479
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,320
And we would never do that with
our eyes in any case.

480
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,720
The next thing we want to do is
we want to have ourselves a

481
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,020
slightly more informed search
by taking into consideration

482
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,525
whether we seem to be
getting anywhere.

483
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:13,490


484
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,550
So, in general, it's a good
thing to get closer to where

485
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,890
we want to go.

486
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:24,200
In general, if we've got a
choice of going to a node

487
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,210
that's close to the goal or a
node that's not so close to

488
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,830
the goal, we'll always want
to go to the one that's

489
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,010
close to the goal.

490
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:35,610
And as soon as we add that to
what we're doing, we have

491
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:47,290
another kind of Search,
which goes by the

492
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,540
name of Hill Climbing.

493
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:56,900


494
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,830
And it's just like Depth-first
Search, except instead of

495
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,540
using lexical order to break
ties, we're going to break

496
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,290
ties according to which node
is closer to the goal.

497
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,720


498
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,260
I went to some trouble
to talk to you about

499
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,680
this enqueued list.

500
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,020
And having gone to that
trouble, I'm now

501
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,860
going to ignore it.

502
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,260
Not because it isn't a good
idea, but because trying to

503
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,490
keep track of everything
in the example is

504
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,310
confusing the example.

505
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,350
It won't work out right in the
small example and all that.

506
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:28,270
Put the queueing thing aside,
queued list aside, and think

507
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:33,120
instead just about the value
of going in the direction

508
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,820
that's getting us closer
to the goal.

509
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,520
In Hill Climbing Search, just
like a Depth-first Search, we

510
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,790
have a and b.

511
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,800
And we're still going to list
them lexically on underneath

512
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,636
the parent node.

513
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:53,630
But now which one is so
closer to the goal?

514
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,620
Now, this time b is closer
to the goal than a.

515
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,340
So, instead of following the
Depth-first course, which

516
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,030
would take us down through a,
we're going to go to the one

517
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,890
that's closest which
goes through b.

518
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:08,140
And b can either go to a or c.

519
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:14,670


520
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:19,040
b is six units away from the
goal. a is about seven plus,

521
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,620
not drawn exactly to scale.

522
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,483
Use the numbers not your eyes.

523
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:25,420


524
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,740
Now where are we?

525
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,990
It's symmetric, so a and
c are both equally

526
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,920
far from the goal.

527
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,220
Now we're going to use
the lexical order

528
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,160
to break the tie.

529
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:41,510
Now from s, b, a,
we'll go to d.

530
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,190
And now, which is closest
to the goal?

531
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,340
That's the only choice
we have.

532
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,050
So, now we have no choice but
to go down to the goal.

533
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,250
That's the Hill Climbing way
of doing the search.

534
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,820
And notice that this time
there's no backtracking.

535
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,740


536
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,270
It's not the optimal path.

537
00:28:59,270 --> 00:28:59,940
It's not the best path.

538
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,010
But at least there's
no backtracking.

539
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:02,830
That's not always true.

540
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:07,180
That's just an artifact of
this particular example.

541
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,910
Do you think Hill Climbing would
produce a faster search?

542
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,030
I think so.

543
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,040
Let's see what happens
when we add these

544
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,570
things at one at a time.

545
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:22,790
First, let's turn off
our extended list.

546
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,610


547
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,010
We turned off our
extended list.

548
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,980
And we're going to do
Depth-first again just for the

549
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,040
sake of comparison.

550
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,460
It produces a very roundabout
path with 48 enqueueings.

551
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,230
Now, let's switch over
to Hill Climbing.

552
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:41,780
And what do think?

553
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,630
Do you think it will produce
a straighter path, fewer

554
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,720
enqueueings?

555
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,970
Boom.

556
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,930


557
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,180
You wouldn't not want to
do that, would you?

558
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,450
If you've got some kind of
heuristic that tells you that

559
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,360
you're getting close to the
goal, you should use it.

560
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,330
Now, it's easy to modify my
example over there so that

561
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,550
getting close to the goal
gets you trapped in a

562
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,690
blind alley on e.

563
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,730
That's easy to do.

564
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,280
But that's just an artifact
of the example.

565
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,130
In general, you want to go along
a path that gets you

566
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,060
closer to the goal.

567
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,040
So, that's 23.

568
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,400
I don't know, let's see if using
the extended list filter

569
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,650
does any good.

570
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,870


571
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,360
Yeah, still 23.

572
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:30,670
So, in that particular case
the extension list didn't

573
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,190
actually do us any good, because
we're driving so

574
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,440
directly toward the goal.

575
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,960


576
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,740
OK, that's that.

577
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,410
Now, let's see, is there
any analog to--

578
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:47,580
well, we might say that this
is yet another way of

579
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,750
distinguishing the searches.

580
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:57,990
And that is, is it an
informed search?

581
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,620


582
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,540
Is it making use of any kind
of heuristic information?

583
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,640
Certainly, a British Museum
is not, Depth is

584
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,530
not, Breadth is not.

585
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,980
And now let's consider what
we got for Hill Climbing.

586
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,240
Do we want to use
backtracking?

587
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,410
Sure.

588
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,010
Do we want to use an
enqueued list?

589
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,650
Sure.

590
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,210
And it is informed, because it's
taking advantage of this

591
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:18,800
extra information.

592
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,500
It may not be in your problem.

593
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,570
It's not often the case you've
got this information in a map.

594
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:28,040
Your problem may not have any
heuristic measurement of

595
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,325
distance to the goal.

596
00:31:29,325 --> 00:31:31,090
In which case, you
can't do it.

597
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,980
But if you've got it,
you should use it.

598
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,550
Oh, yeah, there's one more.

599
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:40,020
And I've already given it away
by having it on my chart.

600
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,110
It's called Beam Search.

601
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:46,210
And just as Hill Climbing is
an analog of Depth-first

602
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:51,770
Search, Beam Search is a
complement or addition of an

603
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:55,140
informing heuristic to
Breadth-first Search.

604
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,880
What you do is you start
off just like

605
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,130
Breadth-first Search.

606
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:01,190


607
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:05,230
But you say I'm going to limit
the number of paths I'm going

608
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:09,550
to consider at any level to
some small, fixed number,

609
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:12,530
like, in this case,
how about two.

610
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,970
So, I'm going to say that
I have a Beam of

611
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,080
two for my Beam Search.

612
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:25,530


613
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:29,080
Otherwise, I proceed just
like Breadth-first

614
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,330
Search, b, d, a, g.

615
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:36,230


616
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,880
And now I've got that stupid
thing where I'm duplicating my

617
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,110
nodes, because I'm forgetting
about the enqueued list.

618
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,760
But to illustrate Beam Search,
what about I'm going to do now

619
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,080
is I'm going to take all these
paths I've got at the second

620
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,190
level, and I'm only going
to keep the best two.

621
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,130
That's my beam width.

622
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,220
And the best two are the two
that get closest to the goal.

623
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,430
So, those four, b, c, a,
and d, which two get

624
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,945
closest to the goal?

625
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:02,160
Now, b and d.

626
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,530
These guys are trimmed off.

627
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,030
I'm only keeping two
at every level.

628
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,690
Now, going down from b and
d, I have, at the next

629
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,250
level, c and g.

630
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,860
And now I've found the goal.

631
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,790
So, I'm done.

632
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,040
We could do that here, too.

633
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,750


634
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:32,350
We could choose a Beam
Search, not bad.

635
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,940
Let's see, let's try this
thing from the middle.

636
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,530
Let's slow my speed
down a little bit.

637
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,853
Now, are we going to see
anything going off to the left

638
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:44,950
like we did with ordinary
Breadth-first Search?

639
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,640
No, because it's smart.

640
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,780
It doesn't say, I want to go to
a place that's further away

641
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,030
from my goal.

642
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,870


643
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:57,940
Now, let's see, maybe we can go
back to our algorithm now

644
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:07,620
and talk about that enqueueing
mechanism and

645
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,870
talk about Hill Climbing.

646
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:17,170


647
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:21,060
Can I use the same basic search
mechanism, just change

648
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,199
that one line again?

649
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,570
Yes.

650
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:27,199
How do I add new paths to
the queue this time?

651
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,210
Well, it's very much like
Hill Climbing, right?

652
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,880
I want to add them
to the front but

653
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,960
with one little flourish.

654
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,210
What's the flourish?

655
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,460
[? Krishna, ?] what
do you think?

656
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,500
Remember, I want to use my
heuristic information.

657
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,900
So, I not only add them to the
front, but amongst the ones

658
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,705
I'm adding to the front,
what do I do?

659
00:34:43,705 --> 00:34:44,980
AUDIENCE:Check the distance?

660
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,850
PATRICK WINSTON: Check
the distance.

661
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,120
And how do you arrange them?

662
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,958
AUDIENCE:[? You ?]

663
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:49,219
[? keep the ?] minimum
[? first. ?]

664
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:51,570
PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah, you
can put the minimum

665
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,290
first if you like.

666
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,739
But let's sort them.

667
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:56,520
We'll sort them, that will
keep everything straight.

668
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:03,060
So Hill Climbing is
front-sorted.

669
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:13,370


670
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,580
And, finally, how about Beam?

671
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,860
What do we do with Beam Search
to add them to the queue?

672
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,175
Well, it doesn't matter where we
add them, because all we're

673
00:35:21,175 --> 00:35:25,840
going to do is we're going
to keep the w best.

674
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,270
So, with Beam, we'll just
abbreviate that by

675
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:35,070
saying keep w best.

676
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:41,330


677
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,870
Now, you have some of the basic

678
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,450
searches in you're toolkit.

679
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,800
There's one more that's
sometimes talked about.

680
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,710
We've got Depth, Breadth, Best,
and Beam, one more is

681
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,720
Best, Best-first Search.

682
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:04,250
It's a variant where you say,
I've got this tree.

683
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:08,270
It's got a bunch of paths that
terminate in leaves.

684
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,510
Let me just always work on
the leaf node that's

685
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,790
closest to the goal.

686
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,510
It can skip around a little bit
from one place to another.

687
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,490
Because as it pursues one path,
it may not do very well

688
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,350
in some other path
quite distant.

689
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,870
And the tree will become
the best one.

690
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,710


691
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,930
We've actually seen an instance
of that in then

692
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,690
integration program.

693
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,840
It's capable of skipping all
over the place, because it's

694
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,950
always taking the easiest
problem in the search tree, in

695
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,940
the and/or tree, working
on that.

696
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,300
That's Best-first Search.

697
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,340
You can do these sorts
of things in

698
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,780
continuous spaces, too.

699
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,830
And you've done the
mathematics of

700
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:52,580
that in 1802 or something.

701
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,190
But in continuous spaces, the
Hill Climbing sometimes leads

702
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,470
to problems or doesn't
do very well.

703
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:04,140
What kind of a problem can you
encounter in a continuous

704
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,210
space with Hill Climbing?

705
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,726
Well, how would you do
Hill Climbing in

706
00:37:11,726 --> 00:37:12,840
a continuous space?

707
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,550
Let's say we're in the
mountains, and a big

708
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,500
fog has come up.

709
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,470
We're trying to get to the
top of the hill before

710
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,720
we freeze to death.

711
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,006
And we take a few steps north,
a few steps east, west, and

712
00:37:28,006 --> 00:37:30,380
south using our compass.

713
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,510
And we check to see which
direction seems to be doing

714
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,220
the best job of getting
us moving upward.

715
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,140
And that's our Hill Climbing
approach, right?

716
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,700
We have explored four directions
we can go and pick

717
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,180
the best one.

718
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,940
And from there, we pick four,
try all those, pick the best

719
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,800
one, and away we go.

720
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,180
We've got ourselves a Hill
Climbing algorithm.

721
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,210
What's wrong with it?

722
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,710
Or what can be wrong with it?

723
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,840
Sometimes it works just fine.

724
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,330
Yes.

725
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:59,605
SPEAKER 1: You might get stuck
in a local maximum.

726
00:37:59,605 --> 00:38:02,320
PATRICK WINSTON: We might get
stuck in a local maximum.

727
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:10,590
So, problem letter a is that if
this is your space, it may

728
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,450
look like that.

729
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:16,640
And you may get stuck
on a local maximum.

730
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,330
Is there any other kind of
problem that can come up?

731
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:26,215


732
00:38:26,215 --> 00:38:28,820
Well, it all depends on what
the space is like.

733
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,645
Here's a problem where the
space has local maxima.

734
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:33,230


735
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,010
Now, a lot of people have
been killed on Mt.

736
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,000
Washington when the
fog comes up.

737
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,270
And they do freeze
to death, why?

738
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:43,270


739
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,440
The reason they freeze to death
is the Hill Climbing

740
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,080
fails them, and they can't
get to the top

741
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,960
to the ranger station.

742
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,660
And the reason is that there
are large lawns on the

743
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,230
shoulders of Mt.

744
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,580
Washington.

745
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,140
It's quite flat.

746
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,555
So, it's the telephone
pole problem.

747
00:38:58,555 --> 00:39:02,090


748
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:06,120
That space looks like this.

749
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,040
Well, this isn't what Mt.

750
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,910
Washington looks like.

751
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,620
But it's the telephone
pole problem.

752
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:14,370
So, when you're wandering
around here, the idea of

753
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,720
trying a few directions and
picking the one that's best

754
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,210
doesn't help any, because
it's flat.

755
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,090
That can be a problem
with Hill Climbing.

756
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,160
Now, there's one more problem
with Hill Climbing that most

757
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,000
people don't know about.

758
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,253
But it works like this.

759
00:39:30,253 --> 00:39:34,600


760
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,210
This is a particularly
acute problem in

761
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,280
high dimensional spaces.

762
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,110
I'll illustrate it
here just in two.

763
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:44,370
And I'm going to switch from
a regular kind of view to a

764
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,570
contour map.

765
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:54,950
So, my contour map is going to
betray the presence of a sharp

766
00:39:54,950 --> 00:40:04,050
bridge along the
45 degree line.

767
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,500
Now you see how you can
get in trouble there.

768
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,280
You get in trouble, because
if you take a step in each

769
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,350
direction, every direction
takes you downhill.

770
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,610
And you think you're
at the top.

771
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,826
So, suppose you're right
here and you go north.

772
00:40:19,826 --> 00:40:24,180
That takes you down over
a contour line.

773
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,550
If you go south, that
also takes you down

774
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,000
over contour lines.

775
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,870
Likewise, going west and east
all appear to be taking you

776
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:38,015
down, whereas, in fact, you're
climbing a ridge.

777
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:42,270
And that contour line is the
highest that I've shown.

778
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,900
So, sometimes you
can get fooled--

779
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,000
not stuck, but fooled-- into
thinking you're at the top

780
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,250
when you're actually not.

781
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,830


782
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:54,410
Now, this is a model
something.

783
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:58,130
This subject is about modeling
intelligence.

784
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,680
And this is a kind of algorithm
you frequently need

785
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,580
in order to build an
intelligent system.

786
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,360
But do we have any kind of
Search happening in our heads?

787
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,650


788
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,820
If we're going to model what
goes on inside our heads, do

789
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:19,850
we have to model any kind of
searching in order to do the

790
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:24,010
kinds of things that
we humans do?

791
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:24,720
I suppose so.

792
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,250
Anytime we make a plan, we're
actually evaluating a bunch of

793
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,340
choices and seeing
how they work.

794
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,020
Let me see if I can illustrate
it another way.

795
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,120


796
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:42,260
This is a system that I showed
you a little bit of last time.

797
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,590
And, shoot, I might as well
review one or two things here.

798
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:51,970


799
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,640
I showed you a Macbeth story.

800
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,220
This is the story
I showed you.

801
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,500
And if you had this in a
humanities class, the simplest

802
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,620
questions that might be asked
is why did Macduff kill

803
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:08,240
Macbeth down there
at the bottom?

804
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,960
Did I demonstrate the answering
of questions last

805
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,340
time, or just the development
of the graph?

806
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,000
I can't remember.

807
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,210
But we'll do it again, anyway.

808
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,895
This is somewhat stylized
English.

809
00:42:19,895 --> 00:42:22,570
Just so you'll know,
it doesn't have

810
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,660
to be stylized English.

811
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,330
This is English that's made
available to the Genesis

812
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:31,950
system by way of something
called Story Workbench.

813
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:32,800
There's no free lunch.

814
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,740
Either you can use your human
resources to rewrite the plot

815
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,540
in third grade English.

816
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,940
Or you can use your human
resources to take a more

817
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:43,240
natural, adult-type version of
the story and decorate it with

818
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,510
annotations that make it
possible to absorb it.

819
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:49,970
Just this summer, in a miracle
of summer [? Europe, ?]

820
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:50,313
[? Brit ?]

821
00:42:50,313 --> 00:42:50,656
[? van ?]

822
00:42:50,656 --> 00:42:51,280
[? Zijp-- ?]

823
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,790
one of you--

824
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,630
connected these two
systems together.

825
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:57,030
So, we can now work with stories
that are expressed in

826
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,140
pretty natural English.

827
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,890
Everything in our system is
expressed in English,

828
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,230
including common sense
knowledge--

829
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,810
like if somebody kills
you, you're dead--

830
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:10,880
but more importantly, for
today's illustration, that

831
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,920
reflective level knowledge,
that knowledge about what

832
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,180
revenge is.

833
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:17,790
Here you are.

834
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:20,280
You're in the humanities class,
and someone says,

835
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,800
what's really going
on in the story?

836
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,420
Not the details of who
kills whom, but is

837
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,560
there a Pyrrhic victory?

838
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,140
Does somebody have a success?

839
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,120
Is there an act of revenge?

840
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,380
These are all kinds of things
you might be asked about in

841
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,800
some kind of humanities class.

842
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,470


843
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,810
So, let me fire up the
genesis system.

844
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:52,150


845
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,400
Pray for internet
connectivity.

846
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,730


847
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,850
Launch the system on a read of
that Macbeth story that I

848
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,110
showed you just a moment ago.

849
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,220
At the moment, it's absorbing
information about background

850
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,960
knowledge, and about reflective
level knowledge,

851
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,210
and all that sort of thing.

852
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:15,780


853
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,010
It's building itself
this thing we call

854
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:20,100
an elaboration graph.

855
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,320
It's not quite there yet.

856
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,570
It's still reading background
knowledge.

857
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:30,750


858
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,140
Now it's reading Macbeth.

859
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:36,100
It's building it's elaboration
graph, the same thing you saw

860
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:39,060
last time, except not quite.

861
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,570
Do you see that stuff
down at the bottom?

862
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:44,500
Those are higher level concepts
that it's managed to

863
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,930
find in the Macbeth story.

864
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,180
So, its found a revenge.

865
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,010


866
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:53,510
How did it do that?

867
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:55,560
It searched.

868
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,810
It had a description of what a
revenge is, and it looked to

869
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:01,270
see if that pattern
was exhibited in

870
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:03,420
the elaboration graph.

871
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,940
So, in a combination of things
that were said explicitly and

872
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,650
things that were produced by
knee-jerk if/then rules, the

873
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:11,280
elaboration graph was
sufficiently instantiated that

874
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,580
the revenge pattern
could be found.

875
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,030
That's interesting, Pyrrhic
victory is a little harder.

876
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:21,070
You'd probably get an a if you
said, oh, there's a Pyrrhic

877
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:24,220
victory in here.

878
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,320
There it is.

879
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,750
So, I'll blow that up a
little bit so you can

880
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,870
see what that is.

881
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:32,220
You know what a Pyrrhic
victory is.

882
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:36,190
It's a situation where
everything seems to be going

883
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:41,910
good at first, and
then not so hot.

884
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:46,580
So, Macbeth wants to
be King down here.

885
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,975
And eventually that leads
to becoming King.

886
00:45:48,975 --> 00:45:51,610
But too bad for Macbeth, because
eventually he gets

887
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:52,540
killed in consequence.

888
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,650
So, it's a Pyrrhic victory.

889
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:56,580
All that produced by Search
programs who are looking

890
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,670
through this graph.

891
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,030
Now once you've got the
capability of doing that, of

892
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:04,470
course, then you can find
all sorts of things.

893
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,820
And you can report
them in English.

894
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:09,510
But, more interestingly, you
can answer questions.

895
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,060
Why did Macbeth--

896
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,520
it cares not a hoot about
capitalization.

897
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,920


898
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,160
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: On a
common sense level, it looks

899
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,690
like Dr. Jekyll thinks Macduff
killed Macbeth because Macbeth

900
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,520
angered Macduff on a
reflective level.

901
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,200
It looks like Dr. Jekyll thinks
Macduff killed Macbeth

902
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,720
as part of acts of mistake,
Pyrrhic victory, and revenge.

903
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,410
PATRICK WINSTON: Pretty
corny speech output.

904
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:36,620
But you see the point.

905
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:40,726
How did it get the stuff on
the common sense level?

906
00:46:40,726 --> 00:46:43,420
The same way all those programs
that build goal trees

907
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,600
report, answers the questions.

908
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,687
It's just looking locally around
in the connections in

909
00:46:48,687 --> 00:46:50,410
the goal tree.

910
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:52,880
How did it get the stuff on
the reflective level?

911
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:59,240
By reporting on the searches
that produced information--

912
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,670
it does that by looking for
higher level thoughts about

913
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:07,540
its own thoughts and reporting
in which of those higher level

914
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:12,995
thoughts the incident we asked
about actually occurs.

915
00:47:12,995 --> 00:47:17,020
So, let's see, just for fun, we
might be interested in why

916
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:20,660
Macbeth murdered Duncan.

917
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,600
Wouldn't this be handy if you
hadn't actually read the play,

918
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,276
and here it is, you've got
to write that paper?

919
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:26,400
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:
On a common sense

920
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,790
level, it looks like--

921
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,150
PATRICK WINSTON: I'll pull the
plug on that, because that's

922
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,400
just annoying.

923
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,768


924
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:36,340
Yeah, pretty good, Macbeth wants
to be King, and Duncan

925
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,620
is the King.

926
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,740
Let's see, why did Macbeth
become King?

927
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:51,820


928
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,450
Oh, it won't answer
the question

929
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:54,700
unless I spell it right.

930
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:01,670


931
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,990
I wouldn't be able to show that
to you until last spring.

932
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:07,480
In fact, I wouldn't have been
able to show you this today

933
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,760
until last week with a
tweak this morning.

934
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:15,090
Because we've just now connected
the language output

935
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:17,910
to, of course, [? Cass's ?]

936
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,910
parser system, which is running
in reverse, in order

937
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,040
to generate that English.

938
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,660
So, that's something that has
never before been seen by any

939
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,830
eyes but me.

940
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,650
So, that will conclude what
we have to do today.

941
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:41,488
