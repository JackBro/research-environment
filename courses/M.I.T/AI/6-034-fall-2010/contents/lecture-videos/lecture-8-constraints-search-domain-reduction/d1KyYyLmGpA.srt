00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:09,450
PROF.

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,430
PATRICK WINSTON: It's too bad,
in a way, that we can't paint

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,260
everything black, because this
map coloring problem sure

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,410
would be a lot easier.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,930
So I don't know what we're
going to do about that.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,920
How long is this
going to take?

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,740
Here's what we're going to do.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,480
We're going to wait till either
all the laptops are

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,910
closed, or this program
terminates,

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,160
whichever comes first.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,520


13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,690
So how long is this
going to take?

14
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,590
I actually don't know.

15
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,690
I think it'll take more than the
life time of the universe,

16
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,700
but I'm not sure.

17
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,730
So let's take a look at
a slightly easier

18
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,560
map coloring problem.

19
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,290
We'll stop this one and change
the map to something I call

20
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,340
[? simplicia. ?]

21
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,780
There's 26 states, one for each
letter in the alphabet.

22
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,930
And what we're going to do is
we're going to do a depth

23
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:01,350
first search for a suitable
coloring of this map.

24
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,340
We're going to go in order,
A, B, C, D, E. And as I've

25
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,140
suggested here, at each level
we're going to rotate the

26
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,890
color choices so we don't
over use any one color.

27
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,800
So if we launch this particular
search, this depth

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,830
first attempt to
color this map.

29
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,530
There it goes.

30
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,420
And maybe we should wait
until it terminates.

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,200
Or maybe we should just let it
run and it'll terminate,

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,360
perhaps, sometime within
the lecture.

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,960
Or maybe we should just let
it run over the weekend.

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,979
Or how long do you think we
would have to wait, if we want

35
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:37,206
to come back and watch
it terminate?

36
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:39,250
At roughly 30 frames
a second--

37
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,960
I'm calculating it all in my
head, I don't want to bet my

38
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,530
life on it-- but I think
about 5,000 years.

39
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,330
And if we want to use as many
states as there are in the

40
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,990
United States, in this
demonstration, you get up to

41
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,940
numbers like 10 to
the 17th years--

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,270
17th, 18th, 16th, I'm
not exactly sure.

43
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,670
I did a rough calculation.

44
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,100
And, of course, you could do
some parallels into that, and

45
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,020
it's not as bad as chess, where
you need all the atoms

46
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,358
in the universe and you
still can't do it,

47
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:10,570
and things like that.

48
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,510
Acting as computers.

49
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,420
But still, it's pretty
horrendous.

50
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:20,570
The problem is, well the problem
is illustrated by this

51
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,810
diagram I put in back of me.

52
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,950
If you do a depth first
search and you have a

53
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,590
problem like Texas.

54
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,940
Texas has always, always been
a problem, ever since they

55
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,140
joined the Union.

56
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,329
I could pick on other
states, too.

57
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:45,310
Kentucky, Tennessee, if you're
from those states you

58
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,630
represent something
even worse.

59
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,700
But Texas is down there.

60
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,980
And the trouble is, if you
assign a color to Arizona,

61
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,730
Oklahoma, Arkansas, and
Louisiana first, and then wait

62
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:05,560
around to Texas last, then you
get yourself into a bind by

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,620
your fourth choice, that you
don't discover until you're

64
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,780
48th choice.

65
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,840
So what happens then, is that
you start developing this tree

66
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,710
like this, you get to those
states surrounding Texas.

67
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,940
Texas is last state assigned
a color and there's

68
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,510
nothing left for it.

69
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,316
And that problem was there on
the fourth choice, and you

70
00:03:26,316 --> 00:03:28,700
don't discover it until
your 50th choice.

71
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,040
So you develop a horrendous,
impossible, impossible search.

72
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,070
So you simply can't
do it that way.

73
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,270
But now, not to worry.

74
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,400
I've come equipped with
the idea of constraint

75
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,410
propagation.

76
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,170
So we could just take
a country with four

77
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,840
states, like this.

78
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,180
Each can be labeled red,
green, blue and yellow.

79
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,079
So just like in a case of line
drawings, we'll pile up all

80
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,270
the possible things that the
value can be-- red, green,

81
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,740
blue and yellow.

82
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,420
Red, green, blue and yellow.

83
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,460
Red, green, blue and yellow.

84
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,330
And we start up constraint
propagation.

85
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,200
So we say for the upper left
hand corner state, is there

86
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,329
any reason to believe that
R is impossible?

87
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,190
Well we look at our neighbors
and see what kind of

88
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,329
constraint flows in from them.

89
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,070
And sure, this guy could
be green, and this

90
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,320
guy could be blue.

91
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,060
They don't have to be red,
so there's nothing

92
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,770
that rules out red.

93
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,310
And there's nothing the
rules out blue.

94
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,250
And there's nothing that
rules out yellow.

95
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,430
And there's nothing that
rules out green.

96
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,422
So constraint propagation just
sits there with its finger up

97
00:04:40,422 --> 00:04:43,380
its nose, doing nothing.

98
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:49,630
So it doesn't look like we can
use either depth first search,

99
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,470
or constraint propagation.

100
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,659
So we could just give
up and cry.

101
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:59,500
But maybe there's some other
approach that will help.

102
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,810
So let me actually work
the Texas problem.

103
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:08,690
So with apologies to
Houston and Tyler,

104
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,940
here's a map of Texas.

105
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,696


106
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:16,595
There we are.

107
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:19,660
And here's, roughly
speaking, Arizona

108
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,530
is over here somewhere.

109
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,220
And we've got Oklahoma
in there.

110
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,440
And old Bill Clinton's
state, Arkansas.

111
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,420
And then Louisiana sticks
out there a little bit.

112
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,700
So there's our map of that

113
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,170
particular part of the country.

114
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:43,310
So we've got Arizona here,
Oklahoma here, Arkansas here,

115
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,350
and Louisiana here,
and Texas here.

116
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:52,060
And we have elected to assign
colors to these states, in

117
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,900
that order.

118
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,090
So this is one, two,
three, four.

119
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,970


120
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,530
And we're going to do that.

121
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,720
We're going to rotate our color
choices, just so we

122
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,460
don't over use any one color.

123
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,620
But we're going to also have a
look at Texas as we go around.

124
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,930
Because Texas is a state that
borders on the States they

125
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,740
were choosing colors for.

126
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,050
So the only possible colors that
Texas could be are red,

127
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:28,510
green, blue, and yellow.

128
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,510
So as we make our choices around
here, we'll say that--

129
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,540
we don't have to adhere to any
particular style-- we can say

130
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:43,800
that Arizona is going to get
the colored red, R. That's

131
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,240
going to rule out R over here
for Texas, because no adjacent

132
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,750
states can have the
same color.

133
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,020
Then we go over to Oklahoma, and
we're rotating our color

134
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,670
choices, so we'll say
that can be green.

135
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,610
And that's fine, because it's
consistent with the red here,

136
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,190
but it rules out the
possibility that

137
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,820
Texas could be green.

138
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:10,170
And then we go over here to
Arkansas, red, green, blue.

139
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,460
That's fine, that's consistent
with the green on Oklahoma,

140
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,270
but if we look at its neighbors
we know that Texas

141
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,580
is forever forbidden
to be blue, now.

142
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,110
So now we go over to Louisiana,
and remember, we're

143
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,280
rotating our color choices
because we don't want to

144
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,240
overuse them.

145
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,046
So this means that the first
choice we're going to make

146
00:07:29,046 --> 00:07:30,695
here, for Louisiana,
is yellow.

147
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:33,400


148
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,380
And that's fine because it's
consistent with Arkansas, but

149
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,110
it's not so fine because it's
now ruled out the last

150
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,220
possibility for Texas.

151
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,040
So even though Texas is going
to be the 48th state that we

152
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,770
color, we're going to say,
at this point, there's no

153
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,830
need in going on.

154
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,680
We'd better back up.

155
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,920
Because there's nothing left for
Texas when we get around

156
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,530
to coloring it.

157
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,990
So that means that this yellow
is ruled out here.

158
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,550
This yellow reappears.

159
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,740
We select the next color in my
line for Louisiana, which

160
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,640
happens to be red.

161
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,310
And now that's consistent
with this yellow that's

162
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,800
still left for Texas.

163
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,260
And it's also consistent
with the blue

164
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,270
that's up here for Arkansas.

165
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,210
So that's cool.

166
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,580
I wonder if maybe we could make
an algorithm out of that,

167
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,980
and solve problems like this.

168
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,860
Do you see, sort of, the
intuition of what we're doing?

169
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,970
We're actually using the martial
arts principle, again.

170
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,520
Because the whole problem is
that local constraints,

171
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,600
undiscovered local constraints,
are causing

172
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,720
downstream problems.

173
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,799
So we're going to use the
enemy's powers against him,

174
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,750
and we're going to look at those
local constraints as we

175
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,910
go and make sure they're not
going downstream, not going to

176
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,980
get us later on.

177
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,060
So now I'm going to look like
I'm getting a little formal,

178
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,890
but I'm just getting a little
bit more formal.

179
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:02,090
Because I want to have some
language that I can use to

180
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,100
describe what's going on, so
that it's clear what the

181
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,180
choices are.

182
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,590
So to start off with, we're
going to have to have some

183
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,310
vocabulary.

184
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,670
So let's start up our
vocabulary here.

185
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:22,000
We're going to have a notion
of a variable v. And that's

186
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,250
something that can have
an assignment.

187
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:41,850


188
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,290
There's nothing complicated
about that.

189
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,540
And a value.

190
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,700


191
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,040
A value x is something that
can be in assignment.

192
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,360


193
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,880
It's a little bit circular,
but we're all in computer

194
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,300
science so you know
what I mean.

195
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,770
So the next thing is a little
slightly less obvious, and

196
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:11,870
that's the notion
of a domain, d.

197
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,250
And that's going to be
a bag of values.

198
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,190


199
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,520
OK.

200
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,150
So one more thing.

201
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,400
A constraint.

202
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,810


203
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:36,080
That's a constraint
c, is a limit on--

204
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,670
in our examples it's mostly
going to be pairs of

205
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,910
variables, pairs of
variable values.

206
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,995
But in general, it could
be variable values.

207
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:51,570


208
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,040
So if we go back here to Texas
we could say, OK, how does our

209
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,190
vocabulary drape itself over
that configuration?

210
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:03,420
And the answer is, the states
have the role of variables,

211
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,670
the colors have the
role of values.

212
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,780
And the domains are the
remaining color possibilities

213
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,510
that we can still use on
a particular state.

214
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,770
And the constraint, in this
case, is the simple map

215
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,770
coloring constraint that no
states that share a boundary

216
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,100
can have the same color.

217
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,840
So states are variables, colors
are values, domains are

218
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,760
bags of colors, and
constraints--

219
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,310
there's only one--

220
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,330
adjacent states can't
have the same color.

221
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,440
So that's how it fits with
this vocabulary.

222
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,800
So now, what did I
actually do here?

223
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,950
Well what I actually did here,
I'm going to now formalize a

224
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,500
little by writing it down
in pseudo code.

225
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,100
So here we are, we're going to
have a look at what we did

226
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,630
here with our intuition,
and we're going to

227
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,700
reduce it to a procedure.

228
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,950
And here's the procedure.

229
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,720


230
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,860
Remember, we're doing depth
first search on this stuff.

231
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,650
I did a depth first search.

232
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:10,200
We're going to do a depth first
search, and for each

233
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,580
depth first search
assignment--

234
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:19,190


235
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,610
OK, so here I am, I'm labeling
Arizona, and then Oklahoma,

236
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,250
and then Arkansas, and
then Louisiana.

237
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,500
When I give each one of those a
label, a color, I'm going to

238
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,210
do this procedure.

239
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,495
Every time I make one of
those assignments.

240
00:12:33,495 --> 00:12:36,640
The last one that caused
trouble was

241
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,230
coloring Louisiana yellow.

242
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,520
Each time I put one of those
colors down, each time I make

243
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,070
an assignment, I'm going
to do this procedure.

244
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:56,690
So for each depth first search
assignment, for each variable

245
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,095
v, considered.

246
00:12:58,095 --> 00:13:03,730


247
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,390
Now you don't know what
I mean by considered.

248
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:12,300
But when I put a label, when I
put up a value, show something

249
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,340
as a color for Louisiana,
I thought about Texas.

250
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,340
So I was considering the
variable, Texas, when I made

251
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,662
the assignment for Louisiana.

252
00:13:22,662 --> 00:13:24,890
Now I'm going to be a little bit
vague about what I mean by

253
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:25,720
considered, right now.

254
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,500
Because there are lots of
choices about how much stuff

255
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,240
you actually consider.

256
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,390
So let me just say consider,
and then we'll open that up

257
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,930
and talk about the options in a
moment, so for each variable

258
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,560
v considered for--

259
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,040
let's call that variable
v sub i--

260
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:53,340
for each x sub i, for each value
in the domain of that

261
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,760
variable, consider each of the
things that still surviving.

262
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:13,530
For each of those, for each
constraint c, that's between x

263
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:26,390
sub i, and some x sub j, where
x sub j is an element of the

264
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:29,050
domain of j.

265
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,020
Now that sounds awfully fancy,
but this just says, in the

266
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,940
case of Texas up there, whenever
I consider one of the

267
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,170
values that's still remaining as
a choice for Texas, I want

268
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,700
to consider all of the
constraints between that

269
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,550
variable and the adjacent
states.

270
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,600
And I want to be sure that
anything I leave in the domain

271
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,350
is OK for some selection in
the other states, some

272
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,960
remaining choices in
the other states.

273
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,090
So that's why we're getting
pretty nested here.

274
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,540
But we're doing depth
first search.

275
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,740
We are considering the variables
in a certain

276
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,660
collection of variables.

277
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,160
For each one of those where
considering all the values

278
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,350
that still remain in the domains
of those variables.

279
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,950
And then for each of those
values, we're checking to see

280
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,010
if it satisfies this some
constraint, satisfies the

281
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,280
constraint that are
placed upon it.

282
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,580
So for each of these constraints
if there does not

283
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:40,910
exist an x sub j, such that, the
constraint between x sub i

284
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:51,090
and x sub j is satisfied, well
if in that adjacent place

285
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,770
there's nothing that is
consistent with a value, then

286
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,380
we've got to get rid of it.

287
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,350
If that's true.

288
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,810
If there does not exist some
value in an adjacent variable

289
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,380
such that that constraint is
satisfied, we're hosed.

290
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,770
We've got to get rid
of that value.

291
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:19,370
So we're going to remove
x sub i from d sub i.

292
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,970


293
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,250
OK.

294
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,070
Now, that's fine.

295
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,730
That's sort of what
I did with Texas.

296
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,610
As soon as I plopped down a
value for Louisiana I said,

297
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,770
well what are the possible
values in Texas?

298
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,610
Red, green, blue and yellow.

299
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,620
Let's consider red.

300
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,480
Let's consider the constraints
between Texas and

301
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,160
all adjacent states.

302
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,660
One of those constraints
says it can't be the

303
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,660
same color as Arizona.

304
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,690
The only color I've got
available for Arizona, since

305
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,870
I've already made the
assignment is red.

306
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,580
Red is not consistent with
red, so I've got

307
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,070
to get rid of it.

308
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,080
So it looks complicated, but
it's just intuition.

309
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,780
So what do we do if we get
to a situation where

310
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,710
the domain is empty?

311
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,975
That means whenever we get
around to making assignment to

312
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:06,560
it, there won't be
anything left.

313
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:21,310
So if that ever happens, if the
domain ever becomes empty,

314
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,746
then what do we do?

315
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:23,996
We've got to back up.

316
00:17:23,996 --> 00:17:31,010


317
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,130
So the intuition is clear.

318
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,070
This is the algorithm.

319
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,960
The algorithm when you work
through it, think about

320
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,360
whether it makes sense
and what not.

321
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,370
How it fits with Texas.

322
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,190
Yeah, it sure does.

323
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,160
All we're doing is we're making
these death first

324
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,710
assignments.

325
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,290
And in the neighborhood of those
depth first assignments

326
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,980
we're looking around to see if
the values that are possible

327
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,960
include something.

328
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,180
And if they don't include
anything, we know we made and

329
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:57,380
irrevocable blunder, and
we have to back up.

330
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,050
So that's the essence
of the idea.

331
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,050
Now, how well does it work?

332
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:11,570
Well a little bit depends on
what we choose for considered.

333
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,550
There are lots of choices
for what we consider.

334
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,520


335
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,360
So let me enumerate some of
those choices and then we'll

336
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,710
have a look and see
what they do.

337
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:35,950


338
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,700
Oh I guess one possibility
is to consider nothing.

339
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:50,070


340
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,320
Let's try it out.

341
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,920


342
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,470
So our type of search is
going to be no checks.

343
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,890
What do you think is
going to happen?

344
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,590


345
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,910
We're not even checking
the assignment.

346
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,380
That's pretty fast.

347
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,560
Unfortunately, since we haven't
even check the most

348
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,490
recent assignment, we get lots
of places where there are

349
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,490
states that are adjacent
to each other that

350
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,130
have the same color.

351
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,380
That's no good.

352
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,940


353
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,440
So another thing we can do
is consider everything

354
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,690
everything.

355
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:36,060


356
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,600
That's no good, because that
would say, as soon as we color

357
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,020
our first state, we check to
make sure that all 47 other

358
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,270
states can be colored.

359
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:49,090
That seems like it over
doing it a little bit.

360
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,795
But in any case, at least we
want to check the assignment.

361
00:19:52,795 --> 00:20:01,200


362
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,230
So if we go back here and check
the assignment, let's

363
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,480
see what happens.

364
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,995


365
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:14,950
Type assignments, assignments
only.

366
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,650
Boom.

367
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,580
Aw, gees, that's where I
got in trouble before.

368
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:26,140
This is the thing is going to
run for 17 billion years at

369
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,330
nanosecond or something
like that.

370
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,630
It's only a billion years if
you run it at nanosecond

371
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,760
speed, so I guess maybe
you could do that.

372
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,110
Have a fast computer.

373
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,360
But this isn't going to work
because of our unfortunate

374
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,950
choice of Texas as the last
state to be considered, and

375
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,690
the unfortunate coloring of the
four surrounding states

376
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,280
right up front.

377
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,100
And our unfortunate decision to
rotate the color so as to

378
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,310
avoid overdoing any one color.

379
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,200
So this doesn't work.

380
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,760
We know we went to the trouble
of working out the business

381
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,950
with Texas by hand, using the
domain reduction algorithm.

382
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,470
Better make a note
that this is the

383
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,740
domain reduction algorithm.

384
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:16,340


385
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,250
And what we're going to do is
we're going to check the

386
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,120
neighbors of the assignments.

387
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,970
Just like we did here.

388
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,360
We checked Texas each time
we made one of those four

389
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,050
choices, because it's a neighbor
of all of the choices

390
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,490
of the states that we made.

391
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,640
So one thing to do is
to check neighbors.

392
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,900


393
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,510
This is one, two, three, now
let's see what happens.

394
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:50,250


395
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,805
Check neighbors only, go.

396
00:21:52,805 --> 00:22:11,450


397
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,390
Shoot, I don't know.

398
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:15,560
It's OK with Texas, right?

399
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,522
Because it didn't color the
states around Texas with all

400
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:22,760
of the four color choices.

401
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,770
But it's still getting into
trouble in other places.

402
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,490


403
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,930
Like the states like Missouri,
Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee,

404
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,085
states with lots
of boundaries.

405
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:37,670


406
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:40,080
So I don't know whether
this is going to--

407
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,350
oh, there it finally worked.

408
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,010
It went through a lot
of effort, though.

409
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,540
For the sake of comparison, we
might make a note that it ran

410
00:22:48,540 --> 00:23:01,250
into 9,139 dead ends.

411
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,720
But it did do some good.

412
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,200
It didn't take a length of time
longer than the remaining

413
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,620
part of the universe.

414
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,140
But if it's a good idea to check
the neighbors, if we

415
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,580
make a change to the neighbors,
what might that

416
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,940
suggests that we
do in addition?

417
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,680
Well it might suggest that
if we make a change to a

418
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,790
neighbor, that we check its
neighbors, too, make sure

419
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,040
they're all right.

420
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,470
So another choice
is to propagate.

421
00:23:33,470 --> 00:24:03,460


422
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,370
So propagate through variables
with reduced domains.

423
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,790
Let's see how that works.

424
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:21,510


425
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,760
Wait a minute.

426
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,570


427
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,210
I must have made a mistake.

428
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,470
Let's try that again.

429
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,930
Oh, maybe we better
slow it down.

430
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:35,760


431
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,785
All that grey stuff is showing
the limit of the propagation.

432
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:45,270


433
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:49,790
Man it's, let's see at
four second of 40,

434
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:55,520
that's about 10 seconds.

435
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,190
Boom.

436
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,340
Not bad.

437
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,130
Zero dead ends.

438
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,080
And it was a lot faster.

439
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,854
I didn't happen to notice how
many constraints were checked

440
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:06,130
on that other thing, I think
it was around 20,000 or so.

441
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,700
This is a lot less.

442
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,320
So this looks like
a good idea.

443
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,255
But why did I label
it number five?

444
00:25:14,255 --> 00:25:17,960
Well because there's something
between this and number three.

445
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:32,300
So number four is, through v
with d reduced to one value.

446
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,000


447
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,730
So we're not going to propagate
through all of the

448
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,750
variables which have their
domains shrunk a little bit.

449
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,610
We're only going to propagate
through those that have the

450
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:49,520
greater shrinkage, all the way
down to a single value.

451
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,200
So let's see how that
might work.

452
00:25:51,200 --> 00:26:02,590


453
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,860
Anybody want to place any
bets on this one?

454
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,280
Let's see.

455
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,490
We checked 2,623 constraints
last time.

456
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,740
Let's see what happens
this time.

457
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,580


458
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,930
You can see that the extent of
the gray is less, because it's

459
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,440
not propagating so far.

460
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:28,630


461
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:40,690
And as we breathily await the
answer, I'd say we've found

462
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,505
our winner.

463
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:45,000
As this does a couple of dead
ends, but the number of

464
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,020
constraint checked is
less than 1,000.

465
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,360
So in general, with problems
this, you have all of these

466
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,690
choices for what you consider.

467
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,320
You don't want to consider
nothing, because then you're

468
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,450
not honoring your constraints.

469
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,320
You'll certainly want to
consider the things you just

470
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:05,670
made assignments for, because
otherwise you'll construct a

471
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,910
solution that violates
a constraint.

472
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,190
You don't want to do everything,
because that's

473
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,050
excessive work.

474
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:20,830
And so checking the neighbors
is a good idea, but it's

475
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,305
always better in practice.

476
00:27:23,305 --> 00:27:26,160
In practice, inevitably it's the
case that it's better to

477
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,440
do some propagation through the

478
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,000
things that you've changed.

479
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,520
How much propagation?

480
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,540
It doesn't seem to do much
good to propagate through

481
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,070
things are just changed.

482
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,630
But it does seem to do some good
to propagate through the

483
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,730
things that have changed
and been

484
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,590
reduced to a single value.

485
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,400
So as soon as you get a neighbor
of some assignment

486
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,290
you just made that has its
domain reduced to a single

487
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,730
value, then you check
its neighbors, too.

488
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,410
So you check the neighbors,
of the neighbors, of the

489
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:54,290
neighbors, of the neighbors, on
and on and on, as long as

490
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,950
you've found a domain
being reduced.

491
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,180
And not only being reduced, but
reduced to a signal value.

492
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,580
All right?

493
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,230
So that's the demand reduction
algorithm.

494
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,860
And I guarantee you a
problem like that.

495
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,300
And I know you don't know how
to work those problems yet,

496
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,060
because this is a little
bit abstract.

497
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,340
And to work these problems in
the exam setting you need to

498
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,250
know a little bit about how to
keep track of the variable

499
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,690
values that remain in
the domain, and

500
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,310
that sort of thing.

501
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,810
And you'll learn more about that
in your recitations, and

502
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,780
in this mega recitation,
and in the tutorials.

503
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,240
So we could go home except
that there are few little

504
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,840
flourishes to deal with here.

505
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:43,210
And those flourishes,
include some dirty,

506
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,520
filthy little secrets.

507
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,830
For example, I've chosen,
as my classroom

508
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,390
example, to pick on Texas.

509
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,620
And arranged for this
situation to

510
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,130
be especially ugly.

511
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:01,080
So I could arrange the states
in a different way.

512
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,420
We have highly constrained
states, that have a lot of

513
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,250
bordering states around them.

514
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:11,950
And we have other states, like
Maine, up there, that only

515
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,660
borders on one other state.

516
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,550
So I don't know.

517
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,685
Will, what do you think?

518
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:22,980


519
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,840
Should we arrange the states for
our death first search in

520
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,490
the order of least constrained
to most constrained, or most

521
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,740
constrained to least
constrained?

522
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,690


523
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,080
In other words, should we
start with Missouri, or

524
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,730
Tennessee, or Kentucky, or
something like that?

525
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,254
Or should we start with Maine?

526
00:29:44,254 --> 00:29:46,206
What do you think?

527
00:29:46,206 --> 00:29:49,140
You have a 50% chance of getting
it right, just by

528
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,650
[? looking ?] at points.

529
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,950
WILL: Start with
the most first.

530
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:53,978
PROF.

531
00:29:53,978 --> 00:29:54,920
PATRICK WINSTON: He thinks we
should start with the most

532
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,600
constraint first.

533
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,490
Do we have a volunteer who wants
to suggest that we start

534
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,210
with the least constraint
first?

535
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:05,570
That's the way I always
work on stuff.

536
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,050
I'm working on a book or
something, I have 500 things

537
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,920
to fix, I'll always choose to
work on the easiest stuff

538
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,980
first, so that I feel like I'm
making the list a lot smaller.

539
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,400
Leave the hardest
things to last.

540
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,910
But we don't have any volunteers
who want to bet on

541
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,060
that idea of least
constraint first?

542
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,700
OK.

543
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,010
Jason wants to suggest that
we should work on least

544
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,050
constraint first.

545
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,370
Well we have ground
truth, because we

546
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,620
can just try it out.

547
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:37,300


548
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,030
I guess we'll stick with
our shrinking to one

549
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,950
value thing, here.

550
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,880
But we will reorder things
so that we have the least

551
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,130
constrained first.

552
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,940


553
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,900
So right away, we got
a color for Maine.

554
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,160


555
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,430
Maybe we ought to speed
this up a little bit.

556
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:04,540


557
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,450
Well, that's a good idea.

558
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:12,020
Jason suggested this and we only
1,732 constraints and we

559
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,010
had 59 dead ends.

560
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:18,910
So let's try the other way
around, and we'll go back to

561
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,160
four frames a second.

562
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:32,890


563
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,940
So we're working, kind of from
the middle of the country out,

564
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,330
with this one.

565
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,860
We're going to deal with
Maine, I guess, last.

566
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:43,870


567
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,520
Which is better.

568
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,640
Too bad, I think it looks
like this is better.

569
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,840
In fact, let's not be so
aggressive with the use of

570
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,950
constraint propagation.

571
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,710
Let's just check the
assignments only.

572
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,060
If we go back to an arrangement
where we have

573
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,970
least constrained first, and
we'll crank up the speed.

574
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,140


575
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,190
Well actually, we would have
to crank it up pretty big,

576
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:12,700
because the states like
Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky,

577
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,264
they're going to
be like Texas.

578
00:32:16,264 --> 00:32:18,730
And so were kind of back to
the length of the universe

579
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,420
type problem, here.

580
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,640
With the least constraint
first, and no use of

581
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,090
constraints, other than to check
the current assignment.

582
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:32,440
So let's stop that, though, and
check the most constrained

583
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,790
first, assignments only.

584
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,310
I don't know how long's
this going to take.

585
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,880


586
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,150
That's the dirty
little secret.

587
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:46,010
If we had arranged our states
from most constrained to least

588
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,440
constrained, ordinary depth
first search with none of this

589
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,840
stuff we talked about today
would work just fine.

590
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,090
All right.

591
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,700


592
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,460
So it's a little
bit like games.

593
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,260
Do you use progressive
deepening, or do

594
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,500
you use alpha beta?

595
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,885
And the answer is both.

596
00:33:04,885 --> 00:33:09,730
You use everything you've got
to deal with the problems.

597
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:14,410
And depending on the problem,
one or another of the things

598
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,250
you incorporate into your
approach will work just great,

599
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,040
if you're lucky.

600
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,035
So now, I promise that this is
useful not only for people who

601
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:24,755
want to color maps.

602
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:25,820
God, who wants to do that?

603
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,000
We know it can be done
with four colors.

604
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,870
But it's also useful for
doing all kinds of

605
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,530
resource planning problems.

606
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,900
So I want to show you a resource
planning problem, and

607
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,810
I want you think about--
while I'm doing it--

608
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,900
think about whether it's
actually analogous to the map

609
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,700
coloring problem.

610
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,280
All right?

611
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,180
So here's the deal.

612
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,950
You have just landed a summer
job with the Jet

613
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:50,210
Green, a new airline.

614
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:58,560
And Jet Green is a low cost,
no frills, hardly any

615
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,460
maintenance type of airline.

616
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,730
And they want to fly mostly
between Boston and New York.

617
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,480
Occasionally they want to
fly to Los Angeles.

618
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,880
And they're trying to
get by with the

619
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,889
smallest number of airplanes.

620
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:15,351
So that's why we have a kind of
resource allocation problem

621
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:17,500
with Jet Green.

622
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,889
So I'm going to write
down what their

623
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:20,350
schedule looks like.

624
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:26,590
They have one flight, F1,
that goes from Boston

625
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:32,429
to JFK, like so.

626
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,739
It's an early in
the day flight.

627
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:39,000
Then they want to have
another one, F2, that

628
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,290
flies from JFK to Boston.

629
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:47,389


630
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:50,489
And then they want to have
another flight a little later

631
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:54,610
in the day that flies
from Boston to JFK.

632
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,420


633
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,340
And a little later than that,
they want to have another

634
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:04,580
flight that goes from
JFK to Boston.

635
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,230
They're going to start off
mostly as a shuttle airline in

636
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:07,670
the beginning.

637
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:13,430
So that's F1, F2, F3, and F4.

638
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:18,460
And they have a fifth flight,
F5, that goes from Boston to

639
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,600
Los Angeles, that takes
a long time.

640
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,460
So it looks like this
on the schedule.

641
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,940
Of course we have time
going that way.

642
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,325
So that's Boston to LAX.

643
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:33,836


644
00:35:33,836 --> 00:35:39,870
Now your job is to determine if
they can fly this schedule

645
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,610
with four aircraft?

646
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:45,065
And naturally you don't want to
over use any one aircraft,

647
00:35:45,065 --> 00:35:48,080
because you would like to
have even wear on them.

648
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,840
Right?

649
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,090
So as you make your choices,
you'll rotate the aircraft.

650
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:58,140
So you'll assign to this one
to A1, aircraft number one.

651
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,160
This one will be A2.

652
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,380
This one will be A3.

653
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,160
And this one will be A4.

654
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,370
And, oops, there's no aircraft
left for the flight to Los

655
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,240
Angeles, because you
only have four.

656
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,410
So, it's obvious, right?

657
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:18,450
This is 100%, exactly, the map
coloring problem, even down to

658
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,380
the four choices.

659
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,050
Because, you have the
constraint, the no single

660
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:29,300
physical aircraft can fly two
flights at the same time.

661
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,920
Just like no two adjacent
states can

662
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,820
be colored the same.

663
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:38,025
So there's a no same time
constraint, like so.

664
00:36:38,025 --> 00:36:45,170


665
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,620
So if you were assigning
aircraft to these flights, you

666
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,040
would get down to F4, the fourth
flight, and you would

667
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:59,310
say, well, let's see, this
guy down here can be

668
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,570
A1, A2, A3, or A4.

669
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,700
But if I choose A4 for that
fourth flight, then there

670
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,540
would be nothing left
in its domain.

671
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:14,640
So you've thus set the problem
up to be identical to the map

672
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,540
coloring problem.

673
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,100
And, of course, you can enrich
it with other kinds of

674
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,370
constraints.

675
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,190
So, for example, you
might have--

676
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,980
this is a not same
time constraint--

677
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:31,040


678
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,030
and these, I mean,
this is at JFK.

679
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,590
And it flies out of JFK, so
maybe you can use the same

680
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,670
aircraft for those.

681
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,550
But not if they're right up
against each other, because

682
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:46,110
you have a minimum
ground time rule.

683
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,030
So there's a minimum ground
time constraint here.

684
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,650


685
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,490
And there's a minimum ground
time constraint here.

686
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,400


687
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,230
There's a minimum ground
time constraint here.

688
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:02,030


689
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,310
And if these are at the same
city, then you've got to allow

690
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,520
enough time for them to fly
between the two cities that

691
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,800
are involved.

692
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,820
So the constraints can get a
little bit more complicated,

693
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,430
but the idea is the same.

694
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,690
So you say to me, I don't
trust you, show me.

695
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,660
OK.

696
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,620
So let me show you.

697
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,680
Oh, by the way, there's one
more way to make this map

698
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,930
coloring problem
easier, right?

699
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:27,430


700
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,330
Let's see.

701
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:31,770
The arrangement is going to be
alphabetical, the type is

702
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:37,000
going to be assignments only,
and we know that's a loser.

703
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,650
But not if we use a whole
lot of colors.

704
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:46,520
So it's the use of four colors
that got us into trouble.

705
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,540
Now that's an aside, but
it'll be coming back

706
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,500
in a moment or two.

707
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,951
Scheduling, here's
that problem.

708
00:38:52,951 --> 00:38:55,110
Boom.

709
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,910
You can almost see it working
just like the

710
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,612
map coloring thing.

711
00:38:58,612 --> 00:39:01,940
But that's maybe too easy.

712
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,190
Let's do this one.

713
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,854


714
00:39:06,854 --> 00:39:10,020
See this is just like
[? simplicia. ?]

715
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,520
We've kind of got a goofy
arrangement here that's

716
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,790
guaranteed to lose at the bottom
because of choices made

717
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,700
at the top.

718
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,740
But that's OK.

719
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:25,370
We can that we can stop this,
and we can change to check

720
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,440
neighbors only.

721
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,690
And boom, there it goes.

722
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,830


723
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:34,220
Or alternatively, let me see
if I can do it this way.

724
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:38,738
Most constrained first, type
will be assignments only.

725
00:39:38,738 --> 00:39:41,210
Boom.

726
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,460
That worked fine, too.

727
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,790


728
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,260
So you might choose to have
a slightly harder

729
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,920
problem, like this.

730
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,590
And we can search away.

731
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:58,390


732
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,420
Actually I don't know if this
will complete or not.

733
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,970
This is a randomly generated
example.

734
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:07,060
But you're going to lose your
summer job if you can't figure

735
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,960
out whether you can
do this, or not.

736
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,210
So what are you going to do?

737
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:13,175


738
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:15,040
[? Elliott, ?] you got any
thoughts about how you're

739
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,260
going to save your job?

740
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,850
So here's the question
you've been asked.

741
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:26,380
How many airplanes does
Jet Green need?

742
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,015
And you decide, well, four
seemed to work before, so

743
00:40:30,015 --> 00:40:32,020
we'll try four here.

744
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,980
You're not sure if it's going
to terminate or not, I mean,

745
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,170
in your lifetime, let alone
in your summer job.

746
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:42,760


747
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,890
[? Elliott, ?] let me
give you a hint.

748
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,140
Look at the outline.

749
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,110


750
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,643
The outline up here, on the
board, the last item.

751
00:40:51,643 --> 00:40:52,610
[? ELLIOTT: [INAUDIBLE] ?]

752
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:52,685
PROF.

753
00:40:52,685 --> 00:40:53,935
PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah,
what's that mean?

754
00:40:53,935 --> 00:40:57,030


755
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,380
What's the maximum number of
airplanes we're going to need?

756
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:04,990
Suppose we've got five flights,
what's the maximum

757
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,040
number of airplanes we
would ever need?

758
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,350
Five.

759
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:11,020
What's the minimum number
of airplanes we'll need?

760
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,750
One.

761
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:17,510
So let's try it with a small
number of airplanes and a

762
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,760
large number of airplanes.

763
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:25,430


764
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:29,190
So that showed us very
fast that we can't

765
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,440
do it with one airplane.

766
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:39,210


767
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:43,866
That showed us very fast we can
do it with ten airplanes.

768
00:41:43,866 --> 00:41:46,794
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]

769
00:41:46,794 --> 00:41:51,680
amount of overlappage
from up [INAUDIBLE].

770
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:51,747
PROF.

771
00:41:51,747 --> 00:41:52,997
PATRICK WINSTON: Volunteer?

772
00:41:52,997 --> 00:41:55,110


773
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:58,140
What are we going to do to find
the actual number, as

774
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,080
fast as possible.

775
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,110
And at least give our boss a
reasonable answer, even if not

776
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,230
necessarily the exact
number very fast?

777
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,960


778
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,630
It's easy, right?

779
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,840
We're going to start up here
with one computer, and we're

780
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,850
going to start down here
with another computer,

781
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,930
and see what happens.

782
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:19,280
So let's see if we can
do it with nine.

783
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,240


784
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,200
Let's see if we can
do it with eight.

785
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,110


786
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,100
Let's see if we can
do it with seven.

787
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,600
These take almost zero
time, right?

788
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,850
Because they're under
constraint.

789
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:40,720


790
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,130
Wow, that's good, seven.

791
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,810
Let's try six.

792
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,060
Actually let's try two.

793
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,790


794
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,580
It loses fast.

795
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,830
Let's try three.

796
00:42:51,830 --> 00:43:01,860


797
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,120
I don't know.

798
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,440
Maybe if you let it run one long
enough three will work.

799
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,120
I doubt it.

800
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,110
While we're at it though, we
might as well go back here and

801
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:09,790
try it with six.

802
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,040
Remember seven worked
real fast.

803
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,000


804
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,510
Gees, six, that was
six, right?

805
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:17,870
Yeah.

806
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,120
So let's try it with five.

807
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,650


808
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:22,950
OK.

809
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,730
So it runs real fast
with five.

810
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,660
It terminates real quick
with two, so we got

811
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,710
three and four left.

812
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,955
So we could tell our boss, a
la any time algorithm, that

813
00:43:33,955 --> 00:43:35,890
you're not real sure, but you
know it's going to be either

814
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,280
three or four.

815
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,270
And then, you got
two computers.

816
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:43,120
You can let both run and see
if either one terminate.

817
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,730
So you have three and four.

818
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:49,140
My guess is that three will
eventually give up.

819
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,040
But of course, there's another
little problem here.

820
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,700
We haven't used the most
constraint first.

821
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,520
If we did that, we might be
able to do it even faster.

822
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,620
Actually, I don't think I can
make that switch without

823
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,810
getting another random
assignment, but

824
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:04,320
let's see what happens.

825
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,950
Maybe so.

826
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,200
SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE]

827
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,180


828
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:10,266
PROF.

829
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:12,000
PATRICK WINSTON: Oh, I already
had most constraint first?

830
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,370
OK.

831
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,660
So it didn't help to
actually switch.

832
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,750
And I think I've got a new
schedule to work here.

833
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,190
So that's the end
of the story.

834
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:25,250
You can do good resource
allocation if you do several

835
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,510
things are once.

836
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:29,450
Number one, you always want to
use most constraint first.

837
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,350
Number two you want to propagate
through domains

838
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:33,050
produced to a single
algorithm.

839
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:35,380
And number three, if you really
try to figure out what

840
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:39,086
the minimum number of resources
needed is, you do

841
00:44:39,086 --> 00:44:42,380
this under over business and you
can quickly converge on a

842
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,550
narrow range where the search is
taking a long time, and be

843
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:49,310
sure that it lies within
that narrow range.

844
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:52,330
Because when you over resource,
it's fast to

845
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:54,670
complete, and when you
under resource,

846
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,180
it's fast to terminate.

847
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,180
So you can just squeeze
it right down into

848
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,600
a very small range.

849
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,270
And that is the end
of the story.

850
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,700
Enjoy your holiday on Monday.

851
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,660
We'll have two classes next week
on Wednesday and Friday,

852
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,910
as advertised.

853
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:23,757
