1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,584


2
00:00:15,584 --> 00:00:18,820
PATRICK WINSTON: I have
extremely bad news.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,690
Halloween falls this
year on a Sunday.

4
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,880
But we in 6.034 refuse to suffer
the slings and arrows

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,890
of outrageous fortune.

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,980
So we've decided that Halloween
is today, as far

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,190
6.034 is concerned.

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,695
Kenny, could you give
me a hand, please?

9
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:43,910


10
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,305
If you could take that and
put it over there.

11
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:49,260
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]?

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:49,960
PATRICK WINSTON: Mm hm.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,210
Just give it to them.

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,120


15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,990
You can take as much of
this as you like.

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,655
The rest will be given to that
herd of stampeding freshman

17
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:00,905
that comes in after.

18
00:01:00,905 --> 00:01:16,039


19
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:21,000
It's a cornucopia
of legal drugs.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,330
Chocolate does produce a kind of
mild high, and I recommend

21
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,890
it before quizzes and
giving lectures.

22
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,370
I have a friend of mine, one
of the Nobel laureates in

23
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,060
biology, always eats chocolate
before he lectures.

24
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,750
Gives him a little edge.

25
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,930
Otherwise, he'll be flat.

26
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:47,265
So I recommend it.

27
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:54,200


28
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,470
It will take, I suppose, a
little while to digest that

29
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,020
neural net stuff.

30
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,030
A little richer than usual
in mathematics.

31
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,190
So today, we're going to talk
about another effort at

32
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,440
mimicking biology.

33
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,217


34
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:11,550
This is easy stuff.

35
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,460
It's just conceptual.

36
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,890
And you won't see this
on the next quiz.

37
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,040
But you will see it
on the final.

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,650
It's one of those quiz five type
problems, where I ask you

39
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,690
questions to see if you
were here and awake.

40
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,140
So a typical question might
be, Professor Winston is a

41
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,540
creationist, or something
like that.

42
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,290
Not too hard to answer.

43
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:40,970
In any event, if it's been
hard to develop a real

44
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,210
understanding of intelligence,
occasionally the hope is that

45
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:48,470
by mimicking biology or
mimicking evolution, you can

46
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:53,640
circumnavigate all
the problems.

47
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,550
And one of those kinds
of efforts is

48
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,740
ever to imitate evolution.

49
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,290
So we're going to talk today
about so-called genetic

50
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,840
algorithms, which are
naive attempts

51
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,890
to mimic naive evolution.

52
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,860
Now, I realize that most MIT
students have a basic grasp of

53
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,910
sexual reproduction.

54
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,170
But I've found in talking with
students that many times,

55
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,270
they're a little fuzzy on
some of the details.

56
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,540
So let's start off by reflecting
a little bit about

57
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,320
how that works.

58
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,630
So let's see, we need
pink and blue.

59
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:40,990
And here's our cell, and here
is its nucleus, and here are

60
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,590
mommy and daddy's chromosomes.

61
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,770
We'll just pretend
there's one pair.

62
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,870
Now ordinarily, in
ordinary cell

63
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,440
division, you get two cells.

64
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,660
Both have a nucleus, and the
process of producing them

65
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,310
involves the duplication
of those chromosomes.

66
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:07,360
And then one pair ends up in
each of the child cells, and

67
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,780
that's all there is to that.

68
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,030
That's mitosis.

69
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:16,360


70
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,850
But then, when we talk about
reproduction, it's more

71
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,540
complicated because those
chromosomes get all twisted

72
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,520
up, and they break, and
they recombine.

73
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,330
So when we talk about the cells
that split off from one

74
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:39,440
of these germ cells, it's no
longer appropriate to talk

75
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,850
about the pink one and the blue
one, because the pink one

76
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,280
and the blue one are
all mixed up.

77
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,640
So you get two chromosomes
here and two here.

78
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,920
But through some miracle of
nature, which has always

79
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,850
amazed me, these two cells
split, in turn, into four

80
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,100
cells altogether.

81
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,340


82
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,180
And each of those four cells at
the bottom gets one of the

83
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,400
chromosomes that was produced by
the twisting up of the rope

84
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,250
and recombination.

85
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:23,090
Then, along comes a
special occasion.

86
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:29,390
And now we can think of this as
being a blue one and this

87
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,480
as being a pink one.

88
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:38,440
And they come together, and you
get a new person, like so.

89
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,060
Note that your mother and
father's chromosomes are

90
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,335
never, never recombined.

91
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:47,700
It's your grandparents
chromosomes that recombine.

92
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,040
So that's what it's like.

93
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,730
And the main thing to
note about this is--

94
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,570
well, a couple things.

95
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:57,260
If you happen to be female,
this part of the process--

96
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,170
this part over here--

97
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,700
took place before
you were born.

98
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,130
If you happen to be male, it's
going on right now as we

99
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,400
speak, which probably
explains something.

100
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,930
But in any event, it's
going on right now.

101
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:16,330
But whenever it goes on, there
are lots of opportunities for

102
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,200
throwing dice.

103
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,890
So God threw all the dice before
you were born, if you

104
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,190
happen to be a female, in this
part of the process over here.

105
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,100
Then, of course, more dice got
thrown here when the decision

106
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,090
was made about which particular
cells got to fuse

107
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,280
to form a new individual.

108
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,890
So I want to beat on this
idea of lots of choice.

109
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,409
When we talk about genetic
algorithms, and we talk about

110
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:44,409
nature, there are lots
of choices in there.

111
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:47,550
And that means there are lots
of choices to intervene, to

112
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,159
screw around, to make things
work out the way you want.

113
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,120
But in any event,
there we are.

114
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,040
That's the basic idea, and it
all starts with chromosomes.

115
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,380
So we could think of
implementing something that

116
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,735
imitates that with the ACTG
stuff that you learned all

117
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:07,030
about in Seminar 1.

118
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,480
But we're computer scientists.

119
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,700
We don't like Base 4.

120
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,240
We like Base 2.

121
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,320
So I'm going to just suggest
that our chromosomes are

122
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,870
binary in this system that
we're going to build.

123
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,230


124
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,590
So that might be a chromosome.

125
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,280
And it doesn't have
to be binary.

126
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,890
It can be symbolic
for fall I care.

127
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,170
But it's just some string of
things that determine how the

128
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,390
ultimate system behaves.

129
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,230
So it all starts out, then,
with some of these

130
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:46,840
chromosomes, some of these
simulated chromosomes,

131
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,070
simulated, simplified,
and naive.

132
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,570
And there's a population
of chromosomes.

133
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,780
The population of chromosomes--
it might be

134
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,010
subject to a little
bit of mutation.

135
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,100
That is to say, a zero
becomes a one, or a

136
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,430
one becomes a zero.

137
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,170
That happens a lot.

138
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,340
That mutation stuff happens
over here when things get

139
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,940
twisted up and recombined.

140
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,020
There are copying errors
and stuff.

141
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,600
Cosmic rays hit it
all the time.

142
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,060
All sorts of reasons why
there might be a

143
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,090
single point of change.

144
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,970
That produces the
mutation effect.

145
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:32,360
So here, we have a population
that starts off over here.

146
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,929
And some of those things are
subject to mutation.

147
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,976


148
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,429
And you'll note, here's a whole
bunch of choice already.

149
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:44,250
How many of these mutations
do you allow per

150
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,330
chromosome, for example?

151
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,110
How many of the chromosomes
just slip

152
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,280
through without any mutation?

153
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,640
Those are choices
you can make.

154
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,820
Once you've made those choices,
then we have the

155
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,070
crossover phenomenon.

156
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,990


157
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,600
Let's identify one of these guys
as the pink one and one

158
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,820
of these guys as the blue one.

159
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,450
And so now we have the pink one
cruised along as well as

160
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,730
the blue one.

161
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,620
The pink one and the blue one
cross and produce a new

162
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,820
chromosome, just
like in nature.

163
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,720
So we take the front part of
one, back part of the other,

164
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,760
and we fuse them together.

165
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,470
And some may slip by without
any of that, like so.

166
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,935
Well, these things are meant to
be combined in pairs, like

167
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:39,060
so, but they may not have
any crossover in them.

168
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,400
So you have another
set of choices.

169
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,790
How many crossovers do you
allow per recombination?

170
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,190
You get another set
of choices.

171
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:53,280
So now we've got a population
of modified chromosomes

172
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,630
through mutation
and crossover.

173
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,040
So the next thing to do is we
have the genotype to phenotype

174
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,520
transition.

175
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,660
That is to say the chromosome
determines the individual.

176
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,250
It may be a person.

177
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,030
It may be a cow.

178
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,290
It may be a computer program.

179
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,830
I don't care what.

180
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,150
But that code down
there has to be

181
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,670
interpreted to be a something.

182
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,030
So it is the genotype, and it
has to be interpreted to be

183
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,870
something which is the
phenotype, the thing that the

184
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,810
stuff down there is
encoding for.

185
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,955
So here, we have a bunch
of individuals.

186
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:32,840


187
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,030
Now, each of those individuals,
because they have

188
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,230
varying chromosomal composition,
will have a

189
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,480
different fitness.

190
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,380


191
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,890
So these fitnesses might be--

192
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,990
well, who knows how they
might be scored.

193
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,480
But we're computer scientists.

194
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,570
We might as well use numbers.

195
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,970
So maybe this guy's fitness is
88, and this guy's fitness is

196
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,400
77, and so on.

197
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,650
So now that we've
got fitness--

198
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,290


199
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,280
by the way, notice all the
choices involved there--

200
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,410
choice of how you interpret the
genotype, choice about how

201
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,610
the phenotype produces
the fitness.

202
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,480
And now we have a choice about
how the fitness produces a

203
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:21,840
probability, like 0.8 and 0.1,
or something like that--

204
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,500
probability of survival into
the next generation.

205
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,590
So now, once we've got those
probabilities, we actually

206
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,840
have selection.

207
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,250


208
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,620
And those phenotypes out there
produce genotypes, a new set

209
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,890
of chromosomes, and that
completes our loop that goes

210
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,830
back in there.

211
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,630
And so that's the
new generation.

212
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:51,650


213
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,440
Sounds simple.

214
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,960
So if you're going to make this
work, of course, you have

215
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,450
a million choices, as I'm going
to emphasize over and

216
00:11:59,450 --> 00:11:59,950
over again.

217
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:05,220
And one of your choices is,
for example, how do you

218
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,380
compute the probability of
survival to the next

219
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,440
generation given the fitness?

220
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,740
So we have to go, somehow, from
numbers like these to

221
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,830
probabilities like those.

222
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,270
So I'm going to talk about
several ways of doing it.

223
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,920
None of them are magic.

224
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,420
None of them was specified
and stipulated by God

225
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,110
as the right way.

226
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,630
But they have increasingly good
properties with respect

227
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,950
to this kind of processing.

228
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,540
So the simplest thing
you can do--

229
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,340
idea number one for
computing the--

230
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,200
see, what you do is you get this
whole bag of individuals,

231
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,370
and you have to decide who's
going to survive to the next

232
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,800
generation.

233
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,420
So at each step, everything in
the bank has a probability of

234
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,370
being the one you pick out and
put in the next generation.

235
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,480
So at any step, the sum of the
probabilities for each of

236
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,330
those guys is 1, because
that's how

237
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,330
high probability works.

238
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:03,140
The probability of a complete
set, added all up, is

239
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,700
probability of 1.

240
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,370
So one thing you can do is you
can say that the probability

241
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:14,590
that you're going to draw
individual i is equal to, or

242
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,710
maybe is proportional to, the
fitness of that individual.

243
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:25,090


244
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,600
I haven't completed the
expression, so it's not a

245
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,010
probability yet, because some
piece of it won't add up to 1.

246
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,370
How can I ensure that
it will add up to 1?

247
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:34,940
That's easy.

248
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,280
Right.

249
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,140
All I have to do is divide
by the sum of the

250
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,180
fitnesses over i.

251
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,260
So there's a probability measure
that's produced from

252
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,690
the fitnesses.

253
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,602
Yeah.

254
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:48,970
STUDENT: You need to
make sure that the

255
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,338
fitnesses aren't negative.

256
00:13:50,338 --> 00:13:51,780
PATRICK WINSTON: Have to make
sure the fitnesses are what?

257
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,712
STUDENT: Aren't negative.

258
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:54,600
PATRICK WINSTON: He says
I have to make sure the

259
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,350
fitnesses aren't negative.

260
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,020
Yeah, it would be embarrassing
if they were.

261
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,465
So we'll just [? strike ?]
anything like that as 0.

262
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:04,730
You've got a lot of choice how
you can calculate the fitness.

263
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,330
And maybe you will produce
negative numbers, in which

264
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,964
case you have to think a little
bit more about it.

265
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:11,570


266
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,410
So now, what about an example?

267
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,880
Well, I'm going to show
you an example.

268
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,450
Why don't I show you
the example.

269
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,840
What we're going to do is we're
going to have a genetic

270
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,615
algorithm that looks for an
optimal value in a space.

271
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,870


272
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,836
And there's the space.

273
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:32,856
Now, you'll notice it's a bunch
of contour lines, a

274
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:34,840
bunch of hills in that space.

275
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,170
Let me show you how that
space was produced.

276
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:44,250
The fitness is a function of x
and y, and it's equal to the

277
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:50,890
sine of some constant times x,
quantity squared, times the

278
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:57,540
sine of some constant y,
quantity squared, e to the

279
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,910
plus x plus y divided
by some constant.

280
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,830
So sigma and omega there are
just in there so that it kind

281
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:09,890
of makes a nice picture
for demonstration.

282
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:10,790
So there's a space.

283
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,930
And clearly, where you want to
be in this space is in the

284
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,180
upper right-hand corner.

285
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,670


286
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,160
That's the optimal value.

287
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,570
But we have a genetic
algorithm that

288
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,300
doesn't know anything.

289
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,950
All it knows how to do is
mutate and cross over.

290
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,130
So it's going to start off
with a population of 1.

291
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,130
It's a little red dot down
in the lower left.

292
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,080
So here's how it's
going to evolve.

293
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,580
There's going to be s chromosome
consisting of two

294
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,380
numbers, an x number and
a y number, like,

295
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,450
say, 0.3 and 0.7.

296
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:54,080
Here's another one, which
might be 0.6 and 0.2.

297
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,160
So the mutation operator is
going to take one of those

298
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,720
values and change
it a little bit.

299
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,980
So it might say, well, we'll
take 3, and we'll make it 0.2.

300
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,090
And the crossover operation is
going to exchange the x and y

301
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,850
values of pairs.

302
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,180
So if we have a crossover here,
then what we're going to

303
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,060
get out from this one--

304
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,390
well, we're going to get out
a combination of these two.

305
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:22,970


306
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:31,300
And it's going to
look like this.

307
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,740
Because what we're going to do
is we're going to take the x

308
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,120
value of 1 and combine it with
the y value of the other one.

309
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,570
So this is going to be 0.2--

310
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,050
my mutated value and 0.2--

311
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:46,420
and this is going to
be 0.6 and 0.7.

312
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,300
So that's how my little genetic
algorithm heck is

313
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,860
going to work.

314
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,090
So having coded this up, we
can now see how it flows.

315
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:01,000


316
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,460
Let's run it 10 generations.

317
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,800
So the population is rapidly
expanded to some fixed limit.

318
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,440
I forgot what it is--

319
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
30 or so.

320
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,260
And we can run that
100 generations.

321
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,540
And so this seems to be getting
stuck, kind of, right?

322
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,319
So what's the problem?

323
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,858
The problem is local maxima.

324
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:30,950
This is fundamentally a
hill-climbing mechanism.

325
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,350
Note that I have not included
any crossover so far.

326
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,210


327
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,345
So if I do have crossover,
then if I've got a good x

328
00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:44,050
value and a good y value, I can
cross them over and get

329
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:48,880
them both in the
same situation.

330
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,470
But nevertheless, this thing
doesn't seem to be

331
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,783
working very well.

332
00:17:51,783 --> 00:17:53,635
STUDENT: Professor,
I have a question.

333
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:54,561
PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah.

334
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:56,185
STUDENT: That picture
is just the contour

335
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:56,660
lines of that function.

336
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,570
PATRICK WINSTON: The contour
lines of that function.

337
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,710
So the reason you see a lot of
contour lines in the upper

338
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,680
right is because it gets much
higher because there's that

339
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,290
exponential term that
increases as you

340
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,430
go up to the right.

341
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,270
So I don't know, it looks--

342
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,500
let's put some crossover in
and repeat the experience.

343
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,960


344
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:24,100
We'll run 100 generations.

345
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,560
I don't know.

346
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,440
It just doesn't seem to
be going anywhere.

347
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,760
Sometimes, it'll go right
to the global maximum.

348
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,120
Sometimes it takes
a long time.

349
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,320
It's got a random number
generator in there, so I have

350
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,610
no control over it.

351
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,520
So it's going to get there.

352
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,330
I couldn't tell whether
the crossover was

353
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,236
doing any good or not.

354
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:47,030
Oh, well, here's one.

355
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,970
Let's make this a little
bit more complicated.

356
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,220
Suppose that's the space.

357
00:18:51,220 --> 00:19:02,780


358
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,890
Now it's going to be in real
trouble, because it'll never

359
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,140
get across that moat.

360
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,280


361
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,540
You know, you would think that
it would climb up to the x

362
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,880
maximum or to the y maximum,
but it's not

363
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,990
going to do very well.

364
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,100
Even with crossover, it's just
not going to do very well,

365
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,130
because it's climbing up
those local hills.

366
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,220
Anybody got an idea about one
simple thing we could do to

367
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,100
make it work better?

368
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,860
Yeah, you could increase
step size, right?

369
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,110
Let me you see if
that will help.

370
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:49,360


371
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,750
You know, even that doesn't
seem to help.

372
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,695
So we have to conclude--
do we conclude that

373
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:55,520
this is a bad idea?

374
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,170
Well, we don't have to conclude
it's a bad idea yet,

375
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:04,420
because we may just look at
it and ask why five times.

376
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,050
And we might ask, well, maybe we
can get a better mechanism

377
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,600
in there to translate fitness
into probability of survival.

378
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,540


379
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,480
Using this formula is kind of
strange, anyway, because

380
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,910
suppose temperature is one of
your fitness characteristics.

381
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,520
The hotter, the better.

382
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,310
Then the ratio of the
probability that you'll

383
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:30,730
survive versus the person next
to you, that ratio will depend

384
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,460
on whether you're measuring the
temperature in Celsius or

385
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,680
Fahrenheit, right?

386
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,820
Because you've shifted the
origin that shifts the ratio

387
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,910
that shifts the probability
of success.

388
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,230
So it seems kind of strange to
just take these things right

389
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,550
straight into probabilities.

390
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,820
So a better idea--

391
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,430
idea number two--

392
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,150
is to say, well, shoot, maybe
we don't care about what the

393
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,730
actual fitnesses are.

394
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,160
All we really care about is
the rank order of all the

395
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,520
candidates.

396
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,870
So the candidate with the most
fitness will have the most

397
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,770
probability of getting into
the next generation.

398
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,460
The candidate with the
second-most fitness will have

399
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,880
the second-highest probability,
and so on.

400
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,450
But we're not going to use the
actual fitnesses themselves to

401
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,530
make the determination.

402
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,750
Instead, what we're going
to do with this

403
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,980
mechanism number two--

404
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,390
this is the rank
space method--

405
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:28,670


406
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,370
is this.

407
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,690
We're going to say that
the probability of the

408
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,500
highest-ranking individual
of getting into the next

409
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,465
generation is some constant P
sub c, which, of course, you

410
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:39,720
can select.

411
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,350
You have another choice.

412
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,820
Then, if that guy doesn't get
selected, the probability of

413
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,490
the second-highest-ranking
individual getting in the next

414
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,730
generation is going to be the
probability that that guy

415
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,620
didn't get in there.

416
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:59,870
That's 1 minus P sub c times the
same probability constant.

417
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,360
And so you can see how
this is going.

418
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:10,220
P3 will be equal to 1 minus P
sub c squared terms P sub c.

419
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:18,130
P sub n minus 1 will be equal
to 1 minus that probability

420
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:22,340
constant to the n minus--

421
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:27,370
n minus 2 times P sub c.

422
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,000
And then there's only
one individual left.

423
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,030
And then if you got through all
these guys and haven't got

424
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:37,260
anybody selected, then you've
got to select the last guy.

425
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,640
And so the probability you're
going to select the last guy

426
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,160
is going to be 1 minus P
sub c to the n minus 1.

427
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,140
So it's a probability you've
missed all those guys in the

428
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,300
first n minus 1 choices.

429
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,010
Yeah, it is, honest to God.

430
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,970
See, this is the probability
that this last guys is going

431
00:22:58,970 --> 00:22:59,580
to get selected.

432
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,160
It's not the probability that
it's the last guy getting

433
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,970
selected, given that the others
haven't been select.

434
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,650
Trust me, it's right.

435
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,720
Are you thinking it
ought to be 1?

436
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,592
STUDENT: What?

437
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,080
PATRICK WINSTON: Were you
thinking it ought to be 1?

438
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,326
STUDENT: No, I was thinking that
I was wondering why you

439
00:23:17,326 --> 00:23:19,460
were re-rolling the
dice, so to speak.

440
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,700
PATRICK WINSTON: You are
re-rolling the dice.

441
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,930
You've got a probability each
time, except for the last

442
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,630
time, when, of course,
you have to take it.

443
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,200
There's nothing left.

444
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,050
There's no other choice.

445
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,130
STUDENT: I have a question.

446
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,424
PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah,
[INAUDIBLE].

447
00:23:28,424 --> 00:23:33,244
STUDENT: So when you jump from
[INAUDIBLE], that makes sense.

448
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:35,670
[INAUDIBLE] you're saying
[INAUDIBLE].

449
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,255
PATRICK WINSTON: It's the
probability [INAUDIBLE] the

450
00:23:37,255 --> 00:23:38,421
first two choices.

451
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:39,837
STUDENT: Yeah, but the second
choice had probability one

452
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:41,570
minus P sub c times
P sub c, not--

453
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,410
PATRICK WINSTON: Think
about it this way.

454
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,030
It's the probability you didn't
choose the first two.

455
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,820
So the probability you didn't
choose the first one is one

456
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,130
minus P sub c.

457
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,460
The probability you didn't
choose the next one, as well,

458
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,596
because you're choosing that
next one with probability P

459
00:23:53,596 --> 00:23:56,385
sub c, it's the square of it.

460
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:59,180


461
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,760
So that might work better.

462
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,220
Let's give it a shot.

463
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:11,170
Let's go back to our original
space choice, and we set and

464
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,800
switch to the rank
fitness method.

465
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,200
And we'll run out
100 generations.

466
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,680
Whoa!

467
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,270
What happened there?

468
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,360
That was pretty fast.

469
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,850
Maybe I used a big step size.

470
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:28,714


471
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:30,150
Yeah, that's a little
bit more reasonable.

472
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:30,890
Oops--

473
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,150
what happened?

474
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,910
It's really getting stuck
on a local maximum.

475
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:39,560


476
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,370
So evidently, I've choosed a
constant P sub c such that it

477
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,340
just drove it right up
the nearest hill.

478
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,960
On the other hand, if I change
the step size a little bit,

479
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,690
maybe I can get it
to spread out.

480
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,170
I sure did.

481
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,800
And now that it's managed to
evolve over there to find the

482
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:05,020
maximum value, now I can clamp
down on the step size again.

483
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,730
And now it shows no
more diversity.

484
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,190
It's just locked on to
that global maximum.

485
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,450
So this is not unlike what
evolution sometimes does.

486
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,190


487
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:21,070
Sometimes, species collapse into
a state where they don't

488
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,420
change for 500 million or 600
million years, like sharks,

489
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,670
for example.

490
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,120


491
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,780
Sometimes, they only survive
if they've got a lot of

492
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,780
diversity built into their way
of life so that they can

493
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,750
adjust to habitat changes.

494
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,250
Now, when you increase the
step size, because you're

495
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,245
stuck on a local maximum, it's
like heating up a metal.

496
00:25:44,245 --> 00:25:46,610
You make everything
kind of vibrate

497
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,230
more, make bigger steps.

498
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:53,100
So this kind of process, where
you may start with a big step

499
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,150
size and then gradually reduce
the step size, is called

500
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,480
simulated annealing, because
it's like letting

501
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,000
a metal cool down.

502
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,810
So you start off with a big
temperature-- big step size--

503
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,940
that covers the space.

504
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,400
And then you slowly reduce the
step size, so you actually

505
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,840
crawl up to the local maxima
that are available.

506
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,960
So that seemed to work
pretty well.

507
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,880
Let's see if we can get it
to work on the harder

508
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,130
problem of the moat.

509
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:32,890


510
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,820
So it's not doing very well.

511
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,270
Better increase the step size.

512
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:41,260


513
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,510
No, it's still kind of stuck.

514
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,030


515
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,620
Even though it's got the
capacity to cross over, it's

516
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,010
so stuck on that lower
right-hand corner, it can't

517
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,090
get up that vertical branch
to get to a point where a

518
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:56,440
crossover will produce a value
up there in the upper

519
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,040
right-hand corner.

520
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,445
So we're still not home yet.

521
00:26:58,445 --> 00:27:03,570


522
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,350
So what's the trouble?

523
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:10,390
The trouble is that the fitness
mechanism is just

524
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:14,090
driving things up to
the local maximum.

525
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,025
It's just terribly
unfortunate.

526
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:20,840


527
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,510
What to do?

528
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,690
Well, here's something
you could do.

529
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:26,330
You can say, well, if the
problem is we've lost the

530
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,960
diversity in our population,
then we can measure the

531
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,060
diversity--

532
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,550
not only the fitness of the
set of individuals we're

533
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,510
selecting from, but we can
measure how different they are

534
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,600
on the individuals we've already
selected for the next

535
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,750
population.

536
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,890
In other words, we can get a
diverse population as well as

537
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,530
a fit population if, when we
make our selection, we

538
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,490
consider not only their fitness
but how different they

539
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,290
are from the individuals that
have already been selected.

540
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,250
So that's going to be mechanism
number three.

541
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:07,410


542
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:13,060
So now we have a space,
and we can measure

543
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,620
fitness along one axis--

544
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,620
ordinary fitness--

545
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,380
and this is rank space
fitness, so that's

546
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,026
going to be P sub c.

547
00:28:21,026 --> 00:28:24,150
There will always be
some individual

548
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,520
with the highest fitness.

549
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,680


550
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,600
And over here--

551
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,050
that might not be P
sub c, actually.

552
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,900
But there'll be some individual
with a maximal

553
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,820
fitness, and at any given step
in the selection of the next

554
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,750
population, there'll be some
individual that's maximally

555
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:50,590
diverse from all of the
individuals that have been

556
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:55,300
selected for the next
generation so far.

557
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,120
So what kind of individual would
you like to pick for the

558
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,470
next generation?

559
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:04,620
Well, the one with the highest
fitness rank and the one with

560
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,250
the highest diversity rank.

561
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:11,340
So what you'd really like is
you'd like to have somebody

562
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,590
right there.

563
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,500


564
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,830
And if you can't have somebody
right there, if there's nobody

565
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:21,200
right there with a maximum
fitness, a maximum diversity

566
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,090
at the same time, then maybe you
can draw in iso-goodness

567
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,220
lines, like so, which
are just how far you

568
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,470
are from that ideal.

569
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,510


570
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,630
So let's summarize.

571
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,140
You've got to pick some
individuals for the next

572
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,165
population.

573
00:29:37,165 --> 00:29:40,540
When we pick the first
individual, all we've got to

574
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,560
go on is how fit the individual
is, because there's

575
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,800
nobody else in that
next generation.

576
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,620
After the first individual is
selected, then we can look at

577
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,420
our set of candidates, and we
can say which candidate would

578
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,670
be more different from the set
of things we've already

579
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,850
selected than all the others.

580
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,180
That would get the highest
diversity rank and so on down

581
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,150
the candidate list.

582
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,630
So let's see how that
might work.

583
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:11,330


584
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,380
So we're going to use a
combination of fitness rank

585
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,990
and diversity rank.

586
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,880
And we'll just use the
simple one so far.

587
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,070
We'll use a small step size,
and we'll let this run 100

588
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,530
generations to see
what happens.

589
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:31,570


590
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,120
Bingo.

591
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,100
It crawls right up there,
because it's trying to keep

592
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,520
itself spread out.

593
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,372
It uses that diversity
measurement to do that.

594
00:30:39,372 --> 00:30:43,640
And at the same time, it's
seeking high fitness, so

595
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,250
that's why it's crawling up to
the upper right-hand corner.

596
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:50,170
But in the end, that diversity
piece of it is keeping the

597
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,140
things spread out.

598
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,650
So suppose you're a shark
or something.

599
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,020
You don't care about diversity
anymore, And we could just

600
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,440
turn that off.

601
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,700
Is that thing still running?

602
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,460


603
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,980
Go back to fitness rank--

604
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,500
bingo.

605
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:12,270
So there you are-- you're stuck
for 600 million years.

606
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,000
So let's see if this will
handle the moat problem.

607
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:24,420


608
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,870
See, our step size
is still small.

609
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,110
We'll just let this run.

610
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,837
So the diversity of P sub is
keeping it spread out, pretty

611
00:31:34,837 --> 00:31:37,020
soon, bingo, it's
right in there.

612
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,350
It's across that big moat,
because it's got the crossover

613
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,740
mechanism that combines the best
of the x's and the best

614
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,570
of the y's.

615
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,830
So that seems to work
pretty well.

616
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,400
OK, so see, these are some of
the things that you can think

617
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,570
about when you're thinking--
oh, and of course, we're a

618
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,830
shark, we're going to forget
about diversity.

619
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,950
We'll change the selection
method from fitness and

620
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,245
diversity rank to
just diversity.

621
00:32:01,245 --> 00:32:04,060
It collapses down on to
the highest hill.

622
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,650


623
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,225
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE], what?

624
00:32:09,225 --> 00:32:12,865
STUDENT: How does step size
translate into mutations?

625
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:15,090
PATRICK WINSTON:
Oh, just the--

626
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:19,250
question is, how does step size
translate into mutation?

627
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,820
Instead of allowing myself to
take steps as big as 1/10, I

628
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:27,680
might allow myself to take
steps as big as 3/10,

629
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,190
according to some
distribution.

630
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,430


631
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,680
So what to say about all this?

632
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,630


633
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:40,000
It's very seductive, because
it's nature, right?

634
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,610
The trouble is, it's
naive nature.

635
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:49,280
And as evolutionary theories
go, this is horrible.

636
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,380
This is naive.

637
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,350
So we'd like to use real
evolutionary theory, except we

638
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,360
don't have real evolutionary
theory.

639
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,780
Evolution is still a mystery.

640
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,170
Some things are pretty
obvious.

641
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,490
You can breed fast
race horses.

642
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,450
That works just like so.

643
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,200
The trouble is, we don't have
any real good idea about how

644
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,150
speciation takes place and how
a lot of evolution works,

645
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:15,480
because all these chromosomes
are connected to their

646
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,280
phenotype consequences in very
complicated ways that nobody

647
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,110
fully understands.

648
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,610
So there's a great deal of
magic in that genotype to

649
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,580
phenotype transition
that nobody really

650
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,950
understands very well.

651
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:34,680
So when people write these
programs that are in the style

652
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:40,270
of so-called genetic algorithm,
they're taking a

653
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:44,720
photograph of high school
biology, and they're spending

654
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,920
a long time building programs
based on that naive idea.

655
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:54,430
But that naive idea has lots
of places for intervention,

656
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:58,620
because look at all the things
you can screw around with in

657
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,100
that process of going from one
generation to the next.

658
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,671


659
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:07,110
By the way, what does
mutation do?

660
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,230
It's basically hill
climbing, right?

661
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,310
It's producing a little spread
out, and you're using the

662
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:14,520
fitness thing to
climb the hill.

663
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,380
So you get a lot of choices
about how you handle that.

664
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,630
Then you get a lot of
choices about much

665
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,420
crossover you're doing.

666
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,275
What does crossover do?

667
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:25,690
It kind of combines strong
features of multiple

668
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,469
individuals into one
individual, maybe.

669
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:30,310


670
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,139
So you've got all kinds
of choices there.

671
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,120
And then your genotype to
phenotype translation--

672
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,040
how do you interpret something
like those zeroes and ones as

673
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,480
an if-then rule, for example,
as something that's in the

674
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,969
hands of the designer?

675
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:46,719
Then you've got all the rest of
those things, all which are

676
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,940
left up to the designer.

677
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,170
So in the end, you really
have to ask--

678
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,780
when you see an impressive
demonstration, you have to

679
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,179
say, where does the
credit lie?

680
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:58,690
And I mean that pun
intentionally, because usually

681
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,810
the people who are claiming
the credit are lying about

682
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,380
where it's coming from.

683
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,300
But nevertheless, let me give
you a couple of examples of

684
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:11,730
where this has found actual,
bona fide practical

685
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,890
application.

686
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,080
So when you look for practical
application, you might say,

687
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,630
well, in what kind of problem
does a good front piece

688
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,580
combine with a good back
piece to produce

689
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,640
a good thing overall?

690
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,860
And the answer is, when
you're making a plan.

691
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:33,000
So you might have a problem in
planning that requires you to

692
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,045
take a series of steps.

693
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:39,860


694
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,380
And you might have two
plans, each of which

695
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,500
is a series of steps.

696
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:51,470
And you might combine these to
produce something new that's

697
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:56,710
the front half of one and the
back half of another.

698
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,680
So that's practical application
number one.

699
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,750


700
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,310
And that requires you to
interpret your chromosome as

701
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:09,250
an indicator of the
steps in the plan.

702
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:16,380
Another example is drawn
from a [? UROP ?]

703
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,445
project a student did for
me some years ago.

704
00:36:18,445 --> 00:36:21,170


705
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:21,670
He was a freshman.

706
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,235
He came to me and said, I want
to do a [? UROP ?] project.

707
00:36:24,235 --> 00:36:26,320
And I said, have you
taken 6.034?

708
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,290
And he said no.

709
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,570
And I said, go away.

710
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,900
And he said, I don't
want to go away.

711
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,720
I want to do a [? UROP ?]
project.

712
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,000
So I said, have you
read my book?

713
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,660
He said no.

714
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,800
I said, well, go away, then.

715
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,150
And he said, I don't
want to go away.

716
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,030
I want to do a UROP project.

717
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,860
So I said, I don't have any
[? UROP ?] projects.

718
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,560
He said, that's OK.

719
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,810
I've got my own.

720
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:46,610


721
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:50,310
He's a finance-type guy, so he
was interested in whether he

722
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:54,180
could build a rule-based expert
system that could

723
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,680
predict the winners
at horse races.

724
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,000
So his rule-based expert
system consisted

725
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,750
of rules like this.

726
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:11,650
If x and y, then some
conclusion.

727
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:19,560
If l and m, then some
kind of conclusion.

728
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,770
And from these, he would
produce rules like if x

729
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:29,160
prime-- that's a slightly
mutated version of the x

730
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,070
antecedent--

731
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:38,080
and m, then some conclusion.

732
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,630
So it's mutation
and crossover.

733
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,165
And he was able to produce a
system that seemed to work

734
00:37:43,165 --> 00:37:46,580
about as well as the
handicappers in the newspaper.

735
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:51,090
So he started losing money
at a less fast rate.

736
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:55,660
He is now doing something in
the stock market, they say.

737
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,164
Doesn't talk so much
about it, though.

738
00:37:59,164 --> 00:38:01,380
But an interesting
application.

739
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,050
He came up with rules like, if
the sum of the jockey's weight

740
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:09,820
on the post position is
low, that's good.

741
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,070
Well, that makes sense in the
end, because the jockey's

742
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:15,330
weight is always between 100 and
110 pounds, and the post

743
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,930
position is always between 1 and
10 or something, so they

744
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,000
were commensurate values.

745
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,996
And a low one is
good, in fact.

746
00:38:21,996 --> 00:38:24,430
Not bad.

747
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,100
But neither of those--

748
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,590
I mean, this is real stuff.

749
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,610
My company uses this
sort of stuff to do

750
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,760
some planning work.

751
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,590
But neither of those is
as impressive as the

752
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:41,680
demonstration I'm about to show
you that involves the

753
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,710
evolution of creatures.

754
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:50,580
And these creatures consist of
block-like objects, like so.

755
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,390
And they combine like
this, and so on.

756
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,950
And so how can you make a
feature like that from a

757
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,050
[? 0-1 ?] chromosome?

758
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:03,600
Well, some of the bits in the
chromosome are interpreted as

759
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,660
the number of objects.

760
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,920
Others are interpreted as the
sizes of the objects.

761
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,575
Others are interpreted as the
structure of how the objects

762
00:39:11,575 --> 00:39:14,080
are articulated.

763
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,410
And still others are interpreted
as fixing the

764
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:23,380
control algorithm by which
the creature operates.

765
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,010
So you see how that
roughly goes?

766
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:29,060
Would you like to see a film
of that in action?

767
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,030
Yes.

768
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,430
OK.

769
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:30,780
[INAUDIBLE]

770
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,110
always likes to see the films.

771
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:42,890


772
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:46,791
STUDENT: How would you measure
diversity in that graph?

773
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:48,810
PATRICK WINSTON: The question
is, how do I measure the

774
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,050
diversity of the graph?

775
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,610
I did it the same way I
measured the fitness.

776
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:56,560
That is to say, I calculated
the distance--

777
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,490
the actual metric distance--

778
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:01,500
of all the candidates for the
next generation from all of

779
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,610
the candidates that had
already been selected.

780
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,602
I summed that up.

781
00:40:05,602 --> 00:40:08,010
And from that sum, I could rank
them according to how

782
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,370
different they were from the
individuals that were already

783
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,760
in the next generation.

784
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,470
It's like giving a rank, and
then from the rank, I use that

785
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:18,550
kind of calculation to determine
a fitness, ie, a

786
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,510
probability of survival, and
then I just combine the two

787
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,466
kinds of probabilities.

788
00:40:21,466 --> 00:40:23,856
STUDENT: So you always kept--
every time that you started

789
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:25,290
something, [? you cached ?]
those.

790
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,680
And you kept everything that
you've ever [INAUDIBLE].

791
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,475
PATRICK WINSTON: I'm always
using the individuals that

792
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:33,135
have already been selected at
every step, so every step is a

793
00:40:33,135 --> 00:40:34,860
little different because it's
working with a new set of

794
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,770
individuals that have already
been selected for the next

795
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,065
generation.

796
00:40:37,065 --> 00:40:38,990
OK?

797
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,240
So let's see how this works.

798
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:49,080


799
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,940
So this is showing
the evolution of

800
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,680
some swimming creatures.

801
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,910
And they're evolved according to
how well they can swim, how

802
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,040
fast they can go.

803
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,390
Some of them have quite exotic
mechanisms, and some of them

804
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,220
quite natural.

805
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,770
That looked like a sperm cell
floating away there.

806
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:09,440


807
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,490
Once you have these things
evolving, then of course, you

808
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,820
can get groups of them
to evolve together.

809
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:19,640


810
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,160
So you saw already some that
were evolving to swim.

811
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,270
These are evolving to move
around on the land.

812
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:32,580
It's interesting-- this was done
by Karl Sims, who at the

813
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,500
time was at a then-thriving
company, Thinking Machines, a

814
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,320
fresh spinoff from MIT.

815
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,200
So he was using a vastly
parallel computer, super

816
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,760
powerful for its day,
thousands of

817
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,710
processors, to do this.

818
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,170
And it was a demonstration
of what you could do

819
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,330
with lots of computing.

820
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:52,340
In the early stages of the
experimentation, though, its

821
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,260
notion of physics wasn't quite
complete, so some of the

822
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,050
creatures evolved to move by
hitting themselves in the

823
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:03,000
chest and not knowing about the
conservation of momentum.

824
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,645
I thought that was just great.

825
00:42:04,645 --> 00:42:09,150


826
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,880
So here they are, out
doing some further--

827
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:27,190


828
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,700
So you look at these, and you
say, wow, there must be

829
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,630
something to this.

830
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,120
This is interesting.

831
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,370
These are complicated.

832
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:40,650


833
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,930
I think this is one of the
ones that was trained,

834
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,440
initially, to swim and then
to do land locomotion.

835
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,760


836
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,670
So eventually, Karl got around
to thinking about how to make

837
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,890
these things evolve so that they
would compete for food.

838
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:02,960


839
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,980
That's the fastest, I think,
by the way, of the land

840
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,630
locomotors.

841
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,990
So that was training them to--
evolving them to jump.

842
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:17,680
This is evolving them to follow
a little red dot.

843
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,910
Some of them have stumbled upon
quite exotic methods, as

844
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,160
you can see.

845
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,380


846
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,880
Seem to be flailing around,
but somehow manage to--

847
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,590
sort of like watching
people take a quiz.

848
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:36,680


849
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,930
Making progress on it.

850
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:42,590


851
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,135
But now we're on to the
food competition.

852
00:43:44,135 --> 00:44:05,590


853
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:08,260
So some of them go for the food,
and some of them go to

854
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,240
excluding their opponent from
the food, not actually caring

855
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,670
too much about whether
they get it.

856
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,850
That's sort of what
children do.

857
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:32,110


858
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:35,070
There's a kind of
hockey player--

859
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:36,270
now, here's two hockey
players.

860
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:37,944
Watch this.

861
00:44:37,944 --> 00:44:39,194
They're kind of--

862
00:44:39,194 --> 00:44:44,940


863
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:45,990
one succeeds--

864
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,270
it reminds me a little
bit of hockey, rugby,

865
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,970
something like that.

866
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:54,400
Sometimes, they just get kind
of confused, go right after

867
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,901
their opponent, forgetting
about the food.

868
00:44:55,901 --> 00:45:11,800


869
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,050
Gives up.

870
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,260


871
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,835
I think these are the
overall winners in

872
00:45:18,835 --> 00:45:21,740
this elimination contest.

873
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,170
I can't quite get there.

874
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:26,840
OK, so you look at that, and
you say, wow, that's cool.

875
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,322
Genetic algorithms must
be the way to go.

876
00:45:30,322 --> 00:45:32,790
I remember the first time
I saw this film.

877
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:33,790
It was over in Kresge.

878
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:37,930
I was walking out of the
auditorium with Toma Poggio

879
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:41,500
And we looked at each other,
and we said the same thing

880
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,180
simultaneously.

881
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,500
We didn't say that genetic
algorithms were the way to go.

882
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:52,520
What we said was, wow, that
space is rich in solutions.

883
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,620
What we were amazed by was not
that simple-minded genetic

884
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,070
algorithms produced solutions
but that the space was so rich

885
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,800
with solutions that almost any
mechanism that was looking

886
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,100
around in that space
would find them.

887
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,190
But there's yet another way of
thinking about it, and that is

888
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:10,270
you could say, wow, look at
how smart Karl Sims is,

889
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,890
because Karl Sims is the one who
had his hands on all the

890
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,050
levers, all those choices.

891
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:18,950
And I kept emphasizing, all
those choices that enabled him

892
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:23,240
to trick this thing, in some
sense, into stumbling across

893
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,510
the solutions in a space
that was guaranteed to

894
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:27,750
be rich with solutions.

895
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,430
So you have to ask--

896
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,270
so first of all, diversity
is good.

897
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:33,690
We noticed when we put diversity
into the genetic

898
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,540
algorithm calculations,
we were much

899
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,750
better at finding solutions.

900
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,845
But the next gold star idea that
I'd really like to have

901
00:46:39,845 --> 00:46:42,670
you go away with is the idea
that you have to ask where the

902
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:43,500
credit lies.

903
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,930
Does it lie with the ingenuity
of the programmer or with the

904
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,230
value of the algorithm itself?

905
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:52,880
In this case, impressive as it
is, the credit lies in the

906
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,250
richness of the space and in
the intelligence of the

907
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:58,000
programmer, not necessarily
in the idea of genetic

908
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,250
algorithms.

909
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:15,903
