1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,290


2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,590
PATRICK WINSTON: Well,
don't stop.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,710
Shoot.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,280
I guess we've got to stop.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,310
I will soon go into withdrawal
symptoms that will

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,890
last about six weeks.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,570
But, on the other hand, we all
are beginning to develop a

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,270
sort of tired and
desperate look.

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,500
And perhaps it's a good thing to
get the semester behind us

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,311
and go into solstice
hibernation.

11
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:34,250
Anyway, there's a
lot to do today.

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,490
I want to wrap up a couple
things, talk about what's

13
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,720
next, and maybe get into some
big issues, perhaps a little

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,990
Genesis demo, that
sort of thing.

15
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,150
So here's what we're
going to do first.

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,730
Last time, I talked about
this whole idea

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,440
of structure discovery.

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,180
And really, the whole reason I
cracked and started talking

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,620
about basic methods is because
of the potential utility of

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,790
taking that idea one step
further and finding structure

21
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,170
in situations where you might
not otherwise find it.

22
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,060
It's still an open question
about whether that's best way

23
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:05,740
to think about it.

24
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,990
But here it goes.

25
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,690


26
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,039
Imagine you've got a
couple of stories.

27
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:15,630
And these circles represent
the events in the story.

28
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,320
And now what you'd like to get
out of these stories is some

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,080
kind of finite state graph that
describes the collection

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,760
of stories.

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,350
So you might discover, for
example, that these two events

32
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,200
are quite similar.

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,940
And these two events
are quite similar.

34
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,420
So you might use that as a basis
for speculating that

35
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,080
maybe a more compact way of
representing the stuff in the

36
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,020
story would look like this.

37
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,690
Where this one--

38
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,030
let's see.

39
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,800
This one goes with this one,
this one goes with this one

40
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,090
and there's a possibility of
another state in between.

41
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,090
So that's the notion of Bayesian
story merging.

42
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,810
Now I'd like to show you a
little bit more convincing

43
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,830
demonstration of that.

44
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,080
Here's how it goes.

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,765


46
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:18,290
So there are the two stories.

47
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,406
This is just a classroom
demonstration, no big deal.

48
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:23,530
But you can see there's
a sort of parallel

49
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,520
structure in there.

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,995
So this is the work of a
graduate student, Mark

51
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:33,050
Finlayson, who processed those
stories to produce those kinds

52
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,790
of events and those kinds of
events that get assembled into

53
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,600
two story graphs.

54
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,370
And the question is, is the
most probable way of

55
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,640
explaining that corpus
of stories?

56
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,140
And of course, the
answer is no.

57
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:55,680
If you merge some things like
chase and stop, then you get a

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,980
simpler graph, one that is
more probable in the same

59
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,290
sense that we discussed
last time.

60
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,860
Then you can merge run and flee
because they're similar

61
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,880
kinds of events.

62
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,460
And finally, you've got
think and decide.

63
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,980
Boom.

64
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,310
There is your story graph.

65
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,590
And this is the same idea taken
several levels higher

66
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,180
that produce the capacity to
discover, in these two

67
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,180
stories, the concept of revenge,
as promised at the

68
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,860
beginning of our last
discussion.

69
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,630
So sometimes the Bayesian stuff
is the right thing to

70
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,960
do, especially if you
don't know anything.

71
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,370
But sometimes you
do know stuff.

72
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,320
And when you do know stuff it's
possible that you can do

73
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,560
something very much
more efficient.

74
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,200
This sort of thing
takes clouds of

75
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,130
computers to process.

76
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,670
But we learned a lot of stuff
in the course of our

77
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,670
development that we don't
use a cloud of

78
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,650
computers to figure out.

79
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:59,250
We learned how to associate the
gestures of our mouth with

80
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,160
the sounds that we make,
for example.

81
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,200
So I want to spend a minute or
two talking about some work

82
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,790
that someday will be the
subject of a couple of

83
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,586
lectures, I think.

84
00:04:10,586 --> 00:04:18,250
But it's the question of how to
use multiple modalities and

85
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,720
correspondences between them
to sort out both of the

86
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,820
contributing modalities.

87
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,910
That sounds contradictory.

88
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,160
Let me show you an example.

89
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,940


90
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,780
This is the example,
a zebra finch.

91
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,090
And it's showing you the result
of a program written by

92
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,700
Michael Coen, now a
professor at the

93
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,409
University of Wisconsin.

94
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:49,420
So the male zebra finch learns
to sing a nice mating song

95
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,159
from its daddy.

96
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:54,240
And this is what one such
zebra finch sounds like.

97
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,690
[BIRD SONG PLAYING]

98
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,100
Nice, don't you think?

99
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,620
And here's what was learned
by a program that uses no

100
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,150
probabilistic stuff at all,
but rather the notion of

101
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,528
cross-modal coupling.

102
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:09,472
[BIRD SONG PLAYING]

103
00:05:09,472 --> 00:05:12,700
Can you tell the difference?

104
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,970
It's not known if this
particular song turns on the

105
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,775
female zebra finch.

106
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:21,750
But to the untrained human
ear, they sure

107
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,550
sound a whole lot alike.

108
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,170
So how does that work?

109
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,420
Here's how that works.

110
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:32,720


111
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,280
Well, I'm not going to show
you how that works.

112
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,350
What I'm going to show you is
how the classroom example

113
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,780
works, the first chapter
example in

114
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,930
Coen's Ph.D. Thesis.

115
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,070
Here's what happens.

116
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,740
When we talk, we produce a
Fourier transform that moves

117
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,250
along with our speech.

118
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,250
And if we say a vowel like aah,
you get a fairly constant

119
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,930
Fourier spectrum.

120
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,800
And you can say, well, where
are the peaks in

121
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,080
that Fourier spectrum?

122
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,260
And how do they correspond to
the appearance of my mouth

123
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,020
when I say the vowel?

124
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,970
So here's how that works.

125
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,980


126
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:14,130
So here's the Fourier spectrum
of a particular vowel.

127
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,530
And when you smooth that, those

128
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,530
peaks are called formants.

129
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,710
And so we're just going to keep
track of the first and

130
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,270
second formant.

131
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,660
But when I say those things,
I also can form an ellipse

132
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,540
around my mouth when
I say them.

133
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,560
And when I form an ellipse
around my mouth when I say

134
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,100
them, that gives me this
second modality.

135
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,010
So the question is, is there
a way of associating the

136
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,690
gestures that produce the sound
with the sound itself?

137
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,600
Well, there's the human data
conveniently provided by a

138
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,480
variety of sources, including
Michael Coen's wife who

139
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,300
produced the lip contour
data on the right.

140
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,150
So that's all marked up and
color coded according to the

141
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,320
particular vowels in English.

142
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,040
I guess there are ten of them.

143
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,120
So we humans all learn that.

144
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,610
But guess what?

145
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,460
We don't learn it from this.

146
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,170
Because we don't get to work
with any marked up data.

147
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,360
We learn it from that.

148
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,710
Somehow we're exposed to the
natural world, and we dig the

149
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,190
vowel sounds out.

150
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,890
It's fantastic how we do that.

151
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,405
But we do have cross modal
coupling data and maybe that's

152
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:25,280
got something to do with it.

153
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,345
So here is a particular
cluster of sounds.

154
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:30,680
And what I want to know is, can
I merge any of these two

155
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,260
clusters to form a bigger
cluster with a

156
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,159
corresponding meaning?

157
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:39,720
So what I can do is, I can say,
well, I can watch these.

158
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,740
I know what the lip
form is when a

159
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,780
particular sound is made.

160
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,770
So I have these correspondences.

161
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,780
So maybe there are four
of those, like so.

162
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,980
And maybe this same guy
projects a couple

163
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,210
of tones into that.

164
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,276
And the question is, can this
guy be combined with any of

165
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:04,190
these guys?

166
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,510
And the answer is yes.

167
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,880
If they're close together on one
side, maybe that suggests

168
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,090
you ought to cluster them
on the other side.

169
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,830
But there's a question about
what close means.

170
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,760
So let's suppose that we also
look at how these guys, these

171
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,555
other two guys, project.

172
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:24,310
And suppose this guy projects
twice up here

173
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,280
and once over here.

174
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,230
And this guy down here
just projects like

175
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,380
crazy into that guy.

176
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,320
Which are closer?

177
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,510
These two or these two?

178
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,190
Well, my diagram's getting
a little closer.

179
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,380
But if you paid attention when
I was drawing it, you would

180
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,570
see that this guy projects in
proportion to that guy.

181
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,030
So if we look at the-- if we
take each of these projections

182
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,440
as the components of a vector,
then those two vectors are in

183
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,380
the same direction.

184
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,020
And the cosine between
them is zero.

185
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,950
So these are the two that are
closest together from that

186
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,460
sort of perspective of
that kind of metric.

187
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,106
And those guys are the ones
who get combined.

188
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:16,793
Would you like to see
a demonstration?

189
00:09:16,793 --> 00:09:17,780
Yeah.

190
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,630
OK, here's a demonstration
based on Coen's work.

191
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:29,960


192
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,350
So here we have two sides.

193
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,572
We could think of one side as
being vowel sounds and the

194
00:09:35,572 --> 00:09:38,930
other side as being lip
contours or something.

195
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,770
But you don't see anything in
the diagram so far about how

196
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,490
these things ought to be
sorted out into groups.

197
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,080
So if I just take one step, why,
it discovers that those

198
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,760
two guys had the
same projection

199
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,700
pattern as each other.

200
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,860
So if I take another step and do
the same thing on the other

201
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:05,130
side, and now in the third step,
the two areas that were

202
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,920
formerly combined now
form a super area.

203
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,260
And they're seen to project in
the same way as the blue area.

204
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,640
So using this kind of projection
idea, I can

205
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,480
gradually build up an
understanding of how those

206
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,730
regions go together.

207
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,310


208
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,710
And I discover, in this
contrived example, that

209
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,290
there's a vertical arrangement
on the right side that

210
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,692
corresponds to a horizontal
arrangement on the left side.

211
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:34,670
Now, you say to me, I'd like to
see something a little bit

212
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,940
more like the lip
contour data.

213
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,890
I'm just stepping through
here until I get

214
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,400
something I kind of like.

215
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,020
Oh, that sounds good.

216
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,540
That seems good.

217
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,420
So there's a correspondence
here.

218
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,730
This is all made up data,
Gaussians of various shapes

219
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,920
and orientations.

220
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,210
Let's see what happens when
I run the clustering

221
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,460
algorithm on that.

222
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:05,300


223
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,860
Something definite was learned
at every step.

224
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,290
We find the correspondence
between the pink region on the

225
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,320
right and the pink region
on the left.

226
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,370
In some cases, where the regions
are rather blurred

227
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,730
together, the other side is the
one that helps the system

228
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,060
figure out how things
are organized.

229
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,390
So I cite this as an example
of something I

230
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,470
think is very important.

231
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,230
Number one, it's possible to
discover regularity without

232
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,440
being obsessively concerned
with Bayesian probability.

233
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,940
And also, that there's very
likely a whole lot of this

234
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,480
going on in human
intelligence.

235
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,630
When we emerge and begin to
examine and explore the world

236
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,520
around us, we're presented with
a lot of unlabeled data

237
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,460
that we've got to
make sense of.

238
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,540
And I believe that this kind of
cross modal coupling idea

239
00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:01,340
is very likely to be bound up
in our understanding of that

240
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,000
world that's presented to us.

241
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,340
It's fast, it's direct.

242
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,465
It doesn't take thousands
of data points.

243
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:08,700
It just happens.

244
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,450
And it happens effortlessly.

245
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,434
And if this isn't built in--

246
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:17,700
if this isn't determined to be
built in, you can come back to

247
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,470
MIT in 15 years and
put me and jail.

248
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,900
Because I think this is really
the way it works.

249
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,950
So there it is.

250
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,800
There's a couple of things
to have wrapped up.

251
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:34,650
And now the next thing I want to
do for the rest of our last

252
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,780
time together in this format
is talk to you about

253
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,200
a variety of things.

254
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,690
And I'll depart from my
usual practice and

255
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,380
move to some slides.

256
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,020
So Dave, could we have the
center screen, please?

257
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:56,970


258
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,900
So first, a brief review of
where we've been and where

259
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,090
we've come.

260
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,600
I think in the very first class,
I talked about what

261
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,570
artificial intelligence was.

262
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,640
And I talked about how you could
view it from either an

263
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,620
engineering perspective or
a scientific perspective.

264
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,930
I'm on the scientific
perspective side.

265
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,730
And I think, nothing against
applications, but I think

266
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,820
we'll be able to make much
more sophisticated and

267
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,970
wonderful applications if we
have not only the engineering

268
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,450
perspective about building stuff
but also the scientific

269
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,250
perspective about understanding
the stuff to

270
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,230
begin with.

271
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,790
So both perspectives
are important.

272
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,590
And in this case you can see
that they all involve

273
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,770
representations, methods,
and architectures.

274
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,850
Dave, I've changed my mind.

275
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,440
Could you also give me
the side screen so

276
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,690
I can see it too?

277
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:53,320


278
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,120
So, that's that.

279
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,750
What's next?

280
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,520
The business perspective,
which we talked about on

281
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,120
Thanksgiving.

282
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,950
The important idea being that
the knee-jerk expectation that

283
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,300
the commercial value of
something is in replacing

284
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,850
people is something that is
not sensible in the first

285
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,250
instance, and demonstrated to be
unlikely and untrue in the

286
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,550
second instance.

287
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,380
The thing that turns people on
from the point of view of

288
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,790
applications is not replacing
people but making new revenue,

289
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,760
making new capability.

290
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,570
And that at once licenses you
to not have something done

291
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,620
exclusively by a computer but
something that can be done in

292
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,506
partnership with a person.

293
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:33,950
So all the important
applications of artificial

294
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,210
intelligence involve people
and computers working in

295
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,740
tandem, with each doing
what they do best--

296
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,170
not with replacing people.

297
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,410
So that's that.

298
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,550
Here's what AI does that makes
AI different from the rest of

299
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,370
the fields that attempt to
contribute to an understanding

300
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,570
of intelligence.

301
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,010
Now, we have the benefit of
having a language for

302
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,430
procedures.

303
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:07,790
We have all the metaphors that
we are the custodians of in

304
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,926
consequences of knowing
about programming.

305
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:14,410
We have the metaphor of
garbage collection.

306
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,770
We can talk about all sorts
of things with programming

307
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:22,430
metaphors that are unavailable
to people in other fields that

308
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,360
are interested in psychology.

309
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,450
We have a way to make models
because we can write programs.

310
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,280
And when we write programs,
there's no question of

311
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,510
sweeping things under the rug.

312
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,690
We have to work out
the details.

313
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,720
And once we've done all that,
then we have opportunities to

314
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,190
experiment that are beyond the
ability to experiment in most

315
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,580
other fields.

316
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,580
Oh, magnificent experiments
are done these days in

317
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,010
developmental psychology
and all the rest of--

318
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,020
all the other branches of
psychology, including MRI

319
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,130
studies that probe into your
brain and see how it's

320
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,010
consuming sugar.

321
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,920
But it's very difficult to
ablate or take away some piece

322
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,840
of your knowledge and see
how you work without it.

323
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,600
I can take the line-drawing
program that we talked about

324
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,820
and say, how will it do if it
doesn't know anything about

325
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,600
fork junctions?

326
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,180
And we can determine
an answer.

327
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,620
But I can't reach into
Sebastian's head here with a

328
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,350
surgical procedure
and take out his

329
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,525
knowledge of fork junctions.

330
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:23,270
It just can't be done.

331
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,730
And finally, another reason why
we're different is because

332
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,460
we can put upper bounds on how
much knowledge is needed in

333
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,530
order to perform a certain
kind of task.

334
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,660
These days, with bulldozer
computing, the question most

335
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,130
often asked is, how can you get
billions of the things off

336
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,810
the web and use them.

337
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,280
We--

338
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,330
I especially-- sometimes ask the
opposite question, which

339
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,310
is how little knowledge
can you have and still

340
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,550
understand a story?

341
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,890
That's what's interesting
to me.

342
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:56,630


343
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,810
So there's a methodological
slide that talks to the

344
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,910
question of how you do
artificial intelligence in

345
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,890
particular and, I suppose,
science in general,

346
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,770
engineering in general.

347
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,329
There's a great tendency in
this field to fall in love

348
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,520
with particular methods.

349
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,964
And we've had people who've
devoted entire careers to

350
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:18,520
neural nets, genetic algorithms,
Bayesian

351
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,829
probability.

352
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:23,480
And that's mechanism envy.

353
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,579
And a better way, in my
judgment, is to say, what is

354
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,170
the problem?

355
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,970
Scientific method-- what's
the problem?

356
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,070
And then bring the right
machinery to bear on the

357
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,610
problem, rather than looking
for things to do with a

358
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,580
particular kind of machinery.

359
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:44,080
So this is the methodology that
first articulated in a

360
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,600
forceful way, by David Marr.

361
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,120
You want to start with the
competence you're trying to

362
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,770
understand, then bring a
representation to bear on it,

363
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,770
a representation that exposes
the constraints and

364
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:55,470
regularities.

365
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,230
Because without those, you
can't make models.

366
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,540
And without those models you
can't understand it, explain

367
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,010
it, predict it, or control it.

368
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:08,540
So it seems to make sense from
a kind of MIT, model-centered

369
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,210
point of view.

370
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,980
And only when you've got all
that straight do you start

371
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,700
working on your methods and
implement an experiment and

372
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,520
then go around that loop.

373
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,330


374
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,320
So that's all I want to say by
way of review, I suppose.

375
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,270
I want to take a minute or two
and just remind you of what's

376
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:28,880
on the final.

377
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,110
And there's nothing to remind
because you all know what's on

378
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,565
the final already.

379
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:37,040
We'll have four sections
corresponding with four exams.

380
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,830
Then we'll have a fifth and
final question that will be

381
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,750
everything else.

382
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,760
All that stuff you slept through
will be featured

383
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,740
there, as well a little problem
on Bayesian inference.

384
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,310


385
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,950
We rearranged the subject,
mostly so I could write the

386
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,400
demonstrations.

387
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,770
So that the Bayesian
stuff didn't come

388
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,100
before the fourth quiz.

389
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,240
Therefore the Bayesian stuff
that you see on those previous

390
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,500
quizzes is likely to be harder
than the stuff that we'll ask

391
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,680
on the final, because you
haven't had as much experience

392
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,370
with it as people
did last year.

393
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,280
I've got a few icons on
there to remind me to

394
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,200
tell you a few things.

395
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,130
As always, open everything
except for computers.

396
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,680
You can wear a costume.

397
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,670
You can do anything you like as
long as it doesn't disturb

398
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,650
your neighbor, within reason.

399
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,650
Well, I guess if it doesn't
disturb neighbor,

400
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,680
it is within reason.

401
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,315
So maybe that's all
I need to say.

402
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:36,270


403
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,730
I'm not sure where we're
going to be.

404
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,920
But it's certainly the case
that, historically, there are

405
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,960
no visible clocks.

406
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,050
So, we soon run out of all of
our cellphones, wrist watches,

407
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,450
and other time pieces
as we hand them out.

408
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,430
So it pays to remember to bring
some kind of timepiece,

409
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,120
because we won't be able to
convey the time very well.

410
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,050
And finally, I see a little
calculator there.

411
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,700
I don't recall any exam where
you actually needed a

412
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,300
calculator.

413
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,270
But it's sort of a security
blanket to have one.

414
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,510
People sometimes see a problem
and say, oh my God, what am I

415
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:07,960
going to do?

416
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,450
I left my calculator at home.

417
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,990
So as to avoid that anxiety,
you might want to bring one

418
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,070
even though you won't need it.

419
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,590
So that's the final.

420
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,650
I'm sure there are
no questions.

421
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,100
Are there?

422
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,900
It's obvious.

423
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,420
Everybody will do well.

424
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,480
Two shots, that whole thing.

425
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,790
Now, what to do next?

426
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,310
Suppose this subject
has turned you on.

427
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,310
There are a variety of things
that you should be thinking

428
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,345
about doing next semester.

429
00:20:36,345 --> 00:20:39,790
And I wanted to review
just a few of those.

430
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,770
One of them is Marvin Minsky's
subject, Society of Mind.

431
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,920
It's very different
from this class.

432
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,450
There are no prepared
lectures.

433
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,690
Marvin doesn't rehearse.

434
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,430
He doesn't think about what he's
going to say in advance.

435
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,950


436
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,530
It's like this except
it's just a

437
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,000
conversation with Marvin.

438
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,430
So many people find themselves
bored stiff for two lectures

439
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,650
out of three.

440
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,720
But then in the third lecture,
Marvin will say something that

441
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,890
you'll think about for a year or
for the rest of your life.

442
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,130
That's what happens to me.

443
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,870
I'm bored stiff two
out three times.

444
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,560
And then the third lecture he
says something, and I think

445
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,510
about it for at least a year
and maybe permanently.

446
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:30,500
So it's an opportunity to see
one of MIT's true geniuses

447
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,300
think out loud.

448
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,130
So it's an experience that you
don't want to miss because

449
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,470
that's what you come here
for, is to see the

450
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,970
geniuses think out loud.

451
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,530
Speaking of geniuses, then
there's Bob Berwick.

452
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:47,310
And he heroically is doing two
subjects in the spring.

453
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,960
Both of which I'd
take if I could.

454
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,090
One is his subject on Language
Understanding.

455
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,920
And the reason I'd take that
is because I believe that

456
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,520
language is at the center of
any explanation of our

457
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,100
intelligence.

458
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,330
So that's the subject I would
be, I suppose, most inclined

459
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,850
to take if I were you.

460
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,460
Well, maybe Minsky's.

461
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,330
It's hard to say.

462
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:13,450
And incidentally, very
heroically, Bob is also

463
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,800
teaching a course on how
evolution works,

464
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,440
how it really works--

465
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,860
in so far as we know how
it really works--

466
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,380
as well.

467
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,130
So both of those will be
offered in the spring.

468
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,630
I don't know how he does it.

469
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,720
I don't know how he does two
all at the same time.

470
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,200
Of course there are lots of
places where you can go to

471
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,770
school, and the faculty will
be teaching five courses at

472
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,800
the same time.

473
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,260
I just think they're
crazy or something.

474
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,110
I don't know how that works.

475
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:43,290
Gerry Sussman will be teaching
his Large Scale Symbolic

476
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,890
System subject.

477
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,840
That's sometimes--

478
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:52,600
oh, I forgot what he wasn't
able to call it, something

479
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,340
that wasn't politically correct
about programming for

480
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,700
people who really, really
like to program.

481
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,700
It's a splendid course on how
to build really big systems.

482
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,250
And we use the ideas in that
subject in our research

483
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,970
system, because it's
the only way--

484
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,010
understanding how that works is
the only way that you can

485
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,845
build systems that are
too big to be built.

486
00:23:12,845 --> 00:23:16,050
I may say a word about
that a little later.

487
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:21,030
So those are my favorite
three/four picks.

488
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,450
But there's lots of
other stuff, too

489
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,090
many things to cover--

490
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,700
the media lab, [INAUDIBLE]

491
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,020
psychology.

492
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,070
There's tons of stuff
out there.

493
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,550
And I would only mention that
courses that have those three

494
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,880
names on them are bound
to be good.

495
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,800
These are colleagues that I
think I have a important

496
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,860
perspective--

497
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,830
not necessarily one I agree
with, but an important

498
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,000
perspective that you
should understand--

499
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,300
Richards, Tenenbaum,
and Sinha.

500
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,590
And now we come to my spring
course, the Human Intelligence

501
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,000
Enterprise.

502
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,190
It's 6.XXX not because there's
anything pornographic about it

503
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,580
but because for a long time, I
couldn't remember it's number.

504
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,610
So I developed a habit of
referring to it as 6.XXX and

505
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,860
it seems to have stuck.

506
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,630


507
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,880
Here's what that's about.

508
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,310


509
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,320
Yeah, that might
be interesting.

510
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,330
It's taught like a humanities
course, though.

511
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,320
No lectures, I just talk.

512
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,975
And all the TAs are veterans of
that class so if you want

513
00:24:23,975 --> 00:24:28,030
to know if you should do it,
you have several resources.

514
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:31,390
You can talk to them.

515
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:37,100
Or you could look at the sorts
of things we talk about.

516
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,970
Here are some things we talk
about by way of packaging.

517
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:45,516


518
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:47,940
Yeah, I can hear a little
tittering there because people

519
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,810
have discovered the
last element.

520
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,750
Some people take the whole
subject because they want to

521
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,460
be present for that unit.

522
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,280
And we talk about all those
kinds of things.

523
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,370
And we look to see what the
common elements are in all

524
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,335
those kinds of packaging
problems of the sort that you

525
00:25:05,335 --> 00:25:09,290
will face over and over again
when you become an adult, no

526
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,470
matter what you do.

527
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:16,010
If you become a business person,
an entrepreneur, a

528
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:21,360
military officer, a scientist,
or an engineer, that packaging

529
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,280
stuff will often make the
difference between whether you

530
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,530
succeed or don't.

531
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,560


532
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,750
And then, that's the second way
you can figure out whether

533
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,480
you want to take the subject.

534
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,330
The content, the TAs, and then
of course you can always

535
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,720
appeal to the Underground
Guide.

536
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,080
And that's why it's very rare
for someone that takes 6.XXX

537
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,290
who hasn't been at this final
lecture because they read the

538
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,090
Underground Guide.

539
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,370
Here is an element that appeared
in the Underground

540
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,840
Guide a few years back.

541
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:06,250


542
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,500
There are no exams.

543
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,870


544
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,930
But there is a tradition of
hacking the Underground Guide.

545
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,910
So this is another example of
something that appeared.

546
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:26,230


547
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,870
So it all came about because
early in the teaching of

548
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,250
6.XXX, I was whining to the
students about the fact that

549
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,490
I've been at MIT for a long
time, since I was freshman.

550
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:39,480
And I still have yet to have
any person I report to say

551
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,210
anything about my teaching--

552
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,230
good, bad, indifferent.

553
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,540
Nothing.

554
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,010
Not a word.

555
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,950
So the students decided that it
would be interesting to see

556
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,400
if they could say something
sufficiently outrageous to

557
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,140
force a conversation between
the department

558
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,750
chairman and me.

559
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,730
And so far they've been
totally unsuccessful.

560
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,490
And I've tried everything.

561
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,605
Winston shows up late if
he shows up at all.

562
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:09,710


563
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,740
Good instructor but constantly
sipping from

564
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,990
a brown paper bag.

565
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,900


566
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,360
All kinds of stuff.

567
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,430
But there it is.

568
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,910
It's a lot of fun.

569
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,220
It's a little oversubscribed so
we have to have a lottery

570
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,560
and there's about 50% chance
and so on and so forth.

571
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:33,410
But many of you will find
it a good thing to do.

572
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:37,340


573
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:37,780
Oh, yeah.

574
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,150
And now I also want to remind
myself that there is a IP

575
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,690
event that's become kind
of MIT tradition.

576
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,030
It's the How to Speak
lecture that I give.

577
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:51,690
This year it'll be on
January 28 in 6120.

578
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:59,850
6120 holds about 120 people
and about 250 show up.

579
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,670
So if you want to go to that
lecture you should show up 15

580
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,380
minutes early.

581
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:09,030
That's a little secret just
between me and 6034 students.

582
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,990
It's about packaging, too.

583
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,350
It's a one-lecture
version of 6.XXX.

584
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,890
But it's very nonlinear because
one thing that you

585
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,860
pick up from that one hour may
make the difference between

586
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,480
you getting the job and some
other slug getting the job.

587
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,240
So it's one of those sorts of
things that can make a big

588
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,670
difference in a short
period of time.

589
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,240
You may sleep through 50 minutes
of the 55 minutes in

590
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,450
that lecture and stay awake
for that one magical five

591
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,250
minutes when you learn something
about when to tell a

592
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:45,870
joke or how to open a lecture
or how to conclude one or a

593
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:50,400
job talk or a sales presentation
or anything.

594
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,580
And that will make it
worthwhile for you.

595
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,440
And then of course there's
the possibility of your--

596
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,530
anybody who's doing [? UROP ?]

597
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:02,000
with me is likely to be
interested in what I've

598
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,600
recently come to call a strong
story hypothesis, something

599
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,320
that we've talked about
from time to time.

600
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,470


601
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,470
That's what makes us humans, and
that's not what they are.

602
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,630
They're orangutans or
chimpanzees, even though the

603
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,020
DNA that we share is--

604
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,580
it goes up and down.

605
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,760
At one point it was 96%,
then it went to 98%.

606
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,610
Now I think it's back
down to 97%.

607
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:32,160
But whatever we are, it's not
because of a huge, massive

608
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,380
difference in DNA between
us and our cousins.

609
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,870
So in my group we
build a Genesis

610
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,300
system, modestly called.

611
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,550
And that's what it looks like.

612
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,950


613
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,490
And it has in it all the sorts
of things that we've talked

614
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,100
about from time to
time in 6034.

615
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,730
And it's about to move into
areas that are especially

616
00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:00,250
interesting, like can you detect
the onset of a possible

617
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,110
disaster before it happens
and intervene?

618
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,580
Can you retrieve presses based
on higher-level concepts?

619
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,830
Things of that sort.

620
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,090


621
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,340
Would you like to see
a demonstration?

622
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,910


623
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,180
OK.

624
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,700
So you've see in a little
bit of this before.

625
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,410
In fact, I'm not even sure
what exactly I've

626
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,060
already shown you.

627
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,396
Let me just get over there
to see what goes on here.

628
00:30:24,396 --> 00:30:29,680
What I'm going to do right now
is I'm just going to read

629
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,222
about Macbeth.

630
00:30:31,222 --> 00:30:34,220
A short precis of the plot.

631
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,060
Not the whole thing,
of course.

632
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,520
Just a few sentences
about the plot.

633
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,630


634
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,420
Right now what it's doing is
absorbing the English and

635
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,612
translating into a sort
of internal language.

636
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:50,500
A sort of universal, internal
language that's all about

637
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,280
trajectories and transitions
and social

638
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,370
relationships and all that.

639
00:30:55,370 --> 00:31:00,800
So it's being read there by
two different persona.

640
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,000
Each of those personas has
a different educational

641
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,040
background, you might say.

642
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,690
They might represent
different cultures.

643
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,060
So eventually they build
up graphs like that.

644
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,790
And everything in white
is stuff that's

645
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,580
explicit in the story.

646
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,495
And everything that's in grey is
stuff that's been inferred

647
00:31:19,495 --> 00:31:21,520
by the system.

648
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,220
So there are several layers
of understanding.

649
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,040
One is what's there
explicitly.

650
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,510
And the other thing that's
there is stuff

651
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,415
that's readily inferred.

652
00:31:29,415 --> 00:31:32,350
And because these persona have
different educational

653
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:37,681
backgrounds, you might say
they see the killing of

654
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:41,490
Macbeth at the end of the
play in a different

655
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,540
light from one another.

656
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,870
One sees it as an act of insane
violence and the other

657
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:50,440
sees it as a consequence
of a revenge.

658
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,680
So once you've got that
capability, you can do all

659
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,240
sorts of things.

660
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,470
For example, you can
ask questions.

661
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,080
So let me arrange it to ask--
by the way, this is a live

662
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,455
demonstration.

663
00:31:59,455 --> 00:32:03,250
I'm thrilled to pieces that
it actually works so far.

664
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,050
Let's see.

665
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:16,600
Why did Macbeth kill Duncan?

666
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,850
You all know why, right?

667
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:22,430


668
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,400
Yeah, you're right.

669
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
He didn't actually do that.

670
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,400
On a common sense level, neither
Dr. Jeckll nor Mr.

671
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,065
Hyde have an opinion.

672
00:32:29,065 --> 00:32:32,420
On a reflective level neither
Dr. Jeckll more Mr. Hyde have

673
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,000
an opinion.

674
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,580
That's because it
didn't happen.

675
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:41,280
So we call these two persona
Doctor Jeckll and Mr. Hyde.

676
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,620
And you're ready to complain
right away about the spelling

677
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,990
of Jeckll, aren't you?

678
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:49,220
Well, that's because with this
spelling the speech generator

679
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:53,550
makes it sound a little bit more
like when we say Jekyll.

680
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,398
But what really happened is that
Macduff killed Macbeth.

681
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:59,820


682
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,520
On a common sense level, it
looks like Dr. Jeckll thinks

683
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,730
Macduff kills Macbeth because
Macduff is insane.

684
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,570
It looks like Mr. Hyde thinks
Macduff kills Macbeth because

685
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,710
Macbeth angers Macduff.

686
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:13,410
On a reflective level, it looks
like Dr. Jeckll thinks

687
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:17,460
Macduff kills Macbeth as part of
an act of insane violence.

688
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,700
It looks like Mr. Hyde thinks
Macduff kills Macbeth as part

689
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,180
of acts of mistake, Pyrrhic
victory, and revenge.

690
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,440
Isn't that cool?

691
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,240
I bet you'd get an A if you had
said that in eighth grade.

692
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,670


693
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:37,500
But once you've got this ability
to understand the

694
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,380
story from multiple points of
view, you begin to think of

695
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,090
all kinds of wonderful
things you can do.

696
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:45,610
For example, you can have Dr.
Jeckll negotiate with Mr.

697
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:48,950
Hyde, because Dr. Jeckll will
be able to understand Mr.

698
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:53,220
Hyde's point of view and
demonstrate to Mr. Hyde that

699
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,960
he thinks that point of
view is legitimate.

700
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,650
Or, Dr. Jeckll can teach Mr.
Hyde the subject matter of a

701
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,740
new domain.

702
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:10,290
Or Dr. Jeckll can watch what's
happening in Mr. Hyde's mind

703
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,020
and avert disaster before
it happens.

704
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:17,770
So let me just show you another
situation here.

705
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,630
I want to turn on the onset
detector and read another

706
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,219
little snippet.

707
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:23,620
This one is about--

708
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,870
what should I do?

709
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,610


710
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,820
We'll do the Russia and
Estonia cyber war.

711
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,900


712
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,820
It's reading background
knowledge right now.

713
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,850
But pretty soon, in the upper
left-hand corner, as it begins

714
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,250
to read the story, you'll see
it spotting the onset of

715
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,739
potential revenge operations
or potential Pyrrhic

716
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:49,370
victories, and show their
foundations begin to emerge

717
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:54,790
and giving the system an
opportunity to intervene.

718
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,540
So there you can see all
the things that it

719
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,690
thinks might happen.

720
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,370
Not all of them do happen.

721
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,773
But some of them do.

722
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:06,820
And you'll note, incidentally,
that this is another case of

723
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,900
Dr. Jeckll and Mr. Hyde having
different cultural

724
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,440
perspectives.

725
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,300
One's an ally of Russia and
one's an ally of Estonia.

726
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,650
One sees it as unwarranted
revenge and the other sees it

727
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,180
as teaching a lesson.

728
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,720


729
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,480
So, I don't know.

730
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,970
What else have we got here?

731
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,540
Oh yeah, president recall.

732
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,880
A long time ago, we talked
about doing information

733
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,210
retrieval based on vectors
of keyword counts.

734
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,860
That's cool but not this cool.

735
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,780
This is doing it on vectors of
concepts that appear in the

736
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,540
stories, such as revenge, even
though the word revenge

737
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,160
doesn't appear anywhere.

738
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,750
So because we're able to
understand the story on

739
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,860
multiple levels, we can use
those higher levels that don't

740
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,010
involve the words in the
story at all to drive

741
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,980
the retrieval process.

742
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,510
So all that is a consequence of
a variety of things, one of

743
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:04,340
which is the specialists that
translate the English into an

744
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,200
internal language.

745
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,360
And it's also, incidentally--

746
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,330
I mentioned it a
little before--

747
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:13,910
it's also a consequence of our
use of Gerry Sussman's

748
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,740
propagator architecture.

749
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,465
So a student comes into
our group and says

750
00:36:17,465 --> 00:36:18,060
he wants to do something.

751
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,870
And we say OK, here's how
the system is organized.

752
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:25,560
It's like a bunch of boxes
that are wired together.

753
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,250
So you get a box and we'll tell
you what the inputs are

754
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,300
going to look like.

755
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,690
And we'll tell you what we
want on the outputs.

756
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,370
And if you don't like the
inputs, just ignore them.

757
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,630
And if we don't like
your outputs,

758
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,500
we'll just ignore that.

759
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,210
So nobody can screw up anything
because they have a

760
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,520
very circumscribed piece of
the system to work with.

761
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:52,110
So I can say, for example, the
president wanted Iraq to move

762
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,640
toward democracy.

763
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,490


764
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,120
And bingo.

765
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,800
That starts a propagation
through that network.

766
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:06,730


767
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,802
All this would be unconvincing,
in my view, if

768
00:37:09,802 --> 00:37:11,810
it weren't eventually connected
to perception.

769
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,270
Because if it's not eventually
connected with perception,

770
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,580
it's yet another system that
demonstrates how smart it can

771
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,420
seem to be without actually
knowing anything.

772
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:25,780
So another half of what we do
is an early stage attempt to

773
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,410
connect the language stuff with
things that are going on

774
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,720
in the world.

775
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,950
So we say, imagine
a jumping action.

776
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,640
And there is a jumping action
that's part of a test sweep

777
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,240
developed by the Defense
Research Projects Agency to

778
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,120
drive what they call the Mind's
Eye program, which was

779
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,090
developed largely as a
consequence of work done here

780
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,770
at MIT, focused on the idea
that if we're going to

781
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,370
understand the nature of
intelligence, we have to

782
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:54,090
understand how language is
coupled into our perceptual

783
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,580
systems and how those perceptual
systems can answer

784
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,830
questions posed to them by
the language system.

785
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:06,000


786
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,710
That's a little demo of
the Genesis system.

787
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,740
Here are the issues that we're
trying to explore.

788
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,530
Nothing too serious, just
the nature of what is

789
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,270
extraordinarily fundamental
to any

790
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,650
explanation of human thinking.

791
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:20,860


792
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,050
Now, all of this might
turn you on.

793
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,370
And you say to me, well, you're
sick and tired of MIT.

794
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,290
You'd like to go somewhere
else for graduate school.

795
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:31,900
So now that I've demonstrated
what we do here, one of the

796
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,360
many things we do here, I'll
talk a little bit about other

797
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,200
places you can go.

798
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,230
This is a sort of MIT-centric
view of the world.

799
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,450


800
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,250
It represents all of the
places you could go

801
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,500
when I was a kid.

802
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,310


803
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,490
But while I've got
this particular

804
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,990
diagram on here, I just--

805
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,670
sort of testing my
MIT arrogance--

806
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,330
I remember a story
often told by my

807
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,025
colleague Peter Szolovits.

808
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:59,770
He says that when he came to a
job interview from Caltech to

809
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,330
MIT, he was sitting here
for three days and

810
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,210
nobody spoke to him.

811
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,740
So eventually he said, I've
got to do something.

812
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,960
He walked up to a graduate
student and said, hi my name

813
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,375
is Peter Szolovits.

814
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:13,370
I'm from Caltech.

815
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,940
And the graduate student
said, Caltech

816
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,190
sucks, and walked away.

817
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,780


818
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,740
Anyway, we've populated all
these places now that you see

819
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,040
here, and more.

820
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,910
This is just a list that I
scratched up this morning.

821
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:32,490
I'm sure I've forgotten many
that have equal right

822
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,810
to be on this list.

823
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:38,190
But in the end, which one you go
to depends on who you want

824
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,270
to apprentice yourself to.

825
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:43,100
Because a graduate school
is an apprenticeship.

826
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,560
And that means if you go to a
place with just one person,

827
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,990
it's OK if that's the person
you want to apprentice

828
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,210
yourself to.

829
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,450
Each of these places has a
different focus because they

830
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,790
have different people.

831
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,260
So you need to find out if
there's somebody at any of

832
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:56,900
these places.

833
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,340
It doesn't matter if it's
AI or some other field.

834
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,930
Theoretical physic-- you've
got to find out if there's

835
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,570
somebody at that place
you want to

836
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,480
apprentice yourself to.

837
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,380
So those site visits are
really important.

838
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,110
And I would like to also stress
that when you make your

839
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:13,310
application to graduate school,
it's very different

840
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,030
from applying to undergraduate
school.

841
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,870
Because they don't care whether
their school is good

842
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,650
for you at all.

843
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,480
They only care about
one thing--

844
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,450
whether you're good
for their school.

845
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,190
So don't get confused and
talk about how it's a

846
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,060
wonderful fit for you.

847
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,360
Because what they're interested
in is whether

848
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,520
you're going to contribute to
their research program.

849
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,860


850
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,490
Oh, I should say that if you're
applying to artificial

851
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:40,870
intelligence that means you
don't say, I'm interested in

852
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,900
all aspects of thinking.

853
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,240
You need to be focused.

854
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,630
There's another reason why
you don't say that you're

855
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:50,180
interested in all aspects of
thinking and that is the

856
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:53,820
defect theory of AI
career selection.

857
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,800
It seems to be the case, strange
though it may seem,

858
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,960
that people in artificial
intelligence often specialize

859
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,050
their research on the things
that they don't do very well

860
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,880
themselves.

861
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,020
So people who study language,
with the exception of Bob

862
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,790
Berwick, often have
trouble getting

863
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,180
out a coherent sentence.

864
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:16,140
And people who do hand-eye
coordination are the sorts who

865
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,540
spill their coffee.

866
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:24,530
So don't say you want to study
all thinking because--

867
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:28,390
The most extreme case of
this, though, is--

868
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,370
if you don't mind, I'll tell you
a story about an extreme

869
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,740
case in this.

870
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,360
We had a visitor from Japan
in the old artificial

871
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,920
intelligence lab
many years ago.

872
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,000
He came for a year.

873
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,080
Let's call him Yoshiaki,
just to pick a name.

874
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,760
Yoshiaki spent a year at the
artificial intelligence lab,

875
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,300
and he left his wife in Japan.

876
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,752
And the reason was,
she was pregnant.

877
00:41:50,752 --> 00:41:54,360
And at that time, you could not
get a visa to the United

878
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,240
States unless you had a
smallpox vaccination.

879
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,990
And because she was pregnant,
she didn't want to get a

880
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:03,650
smallpox vaccination because
there's a small danger to the

881
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,485
fetus if you get a smallpox
vaccination

882
00:42:05,485 --> 00:42:07,000
while you're pregnant.

883
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,060
So she stayed back there.

884
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,580
So Yoshiaki, let us call him--

885
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,960
it was a day before he
was to get on the

886
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,950
airplane to go home.

887
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:17,190
I walked into his office and
his desk was covered with

888
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,080
pictures of his wife.

889
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,630
By the way, Yoshiaki, I should
tell you, is a computer vision

890
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:24,405
guy, interested in object
recognition.

891
00:42:24,405 --> 00:42:27,070


892
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,030
So you might suspect he
has some problem.

893
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,140
So he's looking at
these pictures.

894
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,880
I thought, oh my God, this
is a tender moment.

895
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,140
He's anticipating his
return to Japan and

896
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,140
reunion with his wife.

897
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,620
So I muttered something
to that effect.

898
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,530
And then he looked at me like
I was the king of the fools.

899
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:45,470
And he said, it's not a
question tenderness.

900
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:49,880
I'm afraid I won't recognize
her at the Tokyo airport.

901
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,220
So I said, Yoshiaki.

902
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:52,720
How can this be?

903
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,260
You study computer vision.

904
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,930
You study object recognition.

905
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,400
This is your wife.

906
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,395
How can you think you wouldn't
recognize her

907
00:43:00,395 --> 00:43:03,220
at the Tokyo airport?

908
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,370
And then he looks at me, and--

909
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,840
God is my witness-- he says,
they all look alike.

910
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:16,760


911
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,860
Well now as we come
close to the end,

912
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,680
what are the big questions?

913
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,130
Is it useful?

914
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,310
Of course it's useful.

915
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,630
It's part of the toolkit, now,
of everybody who claims to be

916
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,310
a computer scientist.

917
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,730
What are the powerful ideas
and these things?

918
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,290
Well, here's the most powerful,
powerful idea is the

919
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:33,200
idea of powerful idea.

920
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,450
And here are a few
of my favorites.

921
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:37,900


922
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,930
No surprises there.

923
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,180
That's just Winston's picks.

924
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,030


925
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,340
But there's one more I
would like to add.

926
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,100
And that is all great
ideas are simple.

927
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,770
A lot of times we at MIT confuse
value with complexity.

928
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:53,660
And many of the things that
were the simplest in this

929
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,860
subject are actually
the most powerful.

930
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:05,160
So be careful about confusing
simplicity with triviality and

931
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,000
thinking that something can't
be important unless it's

932
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,580
complicated and deeply
mathematical.

933
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:13,270
It's usually the intuition
that's powerful, and the

934
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:15,380
mathematics is the [INAUDIBLE]
element.

935
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,080


936
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,090
Sometimes people argue that real
intelligence is possible.

937
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,700
One of the most common arguments
is, well what if we

938
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,170
had a room?

939
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:28,630
And you're in the room and
you're asked to translate some

940
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:29,890
Chinese documents.

941
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,140
You've got a bunch of books.

942
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,490


943
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:34,920
And in the end you could
do the translation.

944
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,750
But you cannot be said to
understand Chinese.

945
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:43,260
This is the argument
of Berkeley

946
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,510
philosopher named Sorel.

947
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:46,960


948
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,200
So the trouble is,
it's also true--

949
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,950
well, the argument is the books
aren't intelligent.

950
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:54,900
They're just ink on a page.

951
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,300
And the person is just a
computer, just a processor.

952
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,360
It doesn't actually
know anything.

953
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,660
So since it can't be in either
the person or the

954
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,436
books, it can't be.

955
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:10,410
And that just forgets that
there's a magic that comes

956
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:14,940
about when a running program,
when a process, executes in

957
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,980
time over knowledge that it
continually contributes to.

958
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:22,680
So the reductionist arguments
are among the many that have

959
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,630
been ineffectually posed to
argue that artificial

960
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:27,880
intelligence is impossible.

961
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,170


962
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,990
But that bears longer
discussion.

963
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,980
Let me just bring up the biggest
issue in my mind,

964
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:40,890
which is, it's not the question
of whether we humans

965
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:45,260
are too smart to have our
intelligence duplicated or

966
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,180
excelled in a computer.

967
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,780
It's a question whether we're
smart enough to pull it off.

968
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:54,096
I once had a pet raccoon.

969
00:45:54,096 --> 00:45:56,110
Now, it's illegal to
have a pet raccoon.

970
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:58,710
But this one was an orphan.

971
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:01,510
Its mother had been hit
by a car or something.

972
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,772
A friend of mine brought the
raccoon to me knowing I kind

973
00:46:03,772 --> 00:46:05,900
of like animals.

974
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,600
And I have to say, I kept
the raccoon for a year.

975
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:13,250
At that point, she wanted to
go out and be on her own.

976
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,840
So I had this raccoon.

977
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,760
And this raccoon is smarter than
any dog I've ever had.

978
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,620
Within a day, she learned
how to pry the

979
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,670
refrigerator door open.

980
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:24,150
So I spent that whole year
taping the refrigerator door

981
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,810
shut every time.

982
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,460
And then, we'd play jokes
on each other.

983
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,520


984
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,440
She wouldn't eat hot dogs.

985
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,030
And I wanted her to eat hot
dogs desperately because

986
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:37,880
they're cheap and
easy to serve.

987
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,300
All she would eat was cooked
chicken wings,

988
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,020
wouldn't eat hot dogs.

989
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,755
So one day I said, well, I'm
going to play a trick on her.

990
00:46:44,755 --> 00:46:45,950
I took a chicken bone.

991
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,790
I stuck it in the middle of
a hot dog and put it in a

992
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:48,770
garbage can.

993
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:49,800
And she went for it.

994
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,705
Her genes took over and
she went for it.

995
00:46:51,705 --> 00:46:55,390
And she was happy with
hot dogs ever after.

996
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:56,790
She wouldn't let me read.

997
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:03,050
She would crawl up underneath
the book and

998
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,140
interfere and make me--

999
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,480
she always wanted to suck on
my thumb, which turned blue

1000
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,070
eventually.

1001
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:12,320
You'd be amazed at how much
a raccoon can suck.

1002
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,610
It's just extremely powerful.

1003
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:18,540
The best parts were when she
would go bike riding with me.

1004
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,040
I put on a heavy sweater
because they have

1005
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:20,900
a pretty good grip.

1006
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,710
I'd put on a heavy sweater and
she'd kind of mount herself on

1007
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:27,440
my back and look out over my
shoulder, stopped traffic for

1008
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,690
miles around.

1009
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:31,460


1010
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,460
So she was really smart.

1011
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,960
But the interesting thing is
that at no point did I ever

1012
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,460
presume that that raccoon was
smart enough to build a

1013
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,420
machine that was as smart
as a raccoon.

1014
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,790
So when we think that we can, it
involves a certain element

1015
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:48,320
of hubris that may or may
not be justified.

1016
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,000


1017
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,730
Well, there it is.

1018
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:54,880
Just a couple more
things to do.

1019
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:03,005
One of which is, you should
understand that Kendra and

1020
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:09,610
Kenny and Yuan and Martin and
Gleb are doing a lot of stuff

1021
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,846
that's outside their
job description.

1022
00:48:11,846 --> 00:48:17,290
All of these quiz review deals
that they've arranged are not

1023
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:18,300
in their job description.

1024
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,800
I didn't ask them to do it.

1025
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,710
That's all just plain
old professionalism.

1026
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:24,120
So they've been wonderful
to work with and

1027
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,085
I'd just like to--

1028
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:36,470
[APPLAUSE]

1029
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,710
--offer them a round
of applause.

1030
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:44,180
And of course, Bob and Randy
and Mark have done fabulous

1031
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,810
stuff as well.

1032
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:54,520
And we of the staff, the TAs,
Mark, Bob, and Randy, have

1033
00:48:54,520 --> 00:49:01,360
nothing else to do except wish
you good hunting on the final

1034
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:05,350
and a good long winter solstice
hibernation period

1035
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:07,270
after that.

1036
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:10,420
And that is the end
of the story.

1037
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,620
And we hope you live
happily ever after.

1038
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:30,170
