10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,080
PROFESSOR: Today
we are introducing

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,330
an exciting new pledge in 6034.

12
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,280
Anyone who has already looked at
any of the neural net problems

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,860
will have easily been able to
see that even though Patrick

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,300
only has them back
up to 2006 now,

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,500
there's still-- well out of
four tests, perhaps two or three

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,140
different ways that the
neural nets were drawn.

17
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,960
Our exciting new pledge is
we're going to draw them

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,110
in a particular way this year.

19
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,350
And I will show you which
way, assuming that this works.

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,820
Yes.

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,580
We are going to draw them
like the one on the right.

22
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,050
The one on the left is the
same as the one on the right.

23
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,460
At first, not having
had to explain

24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,209
the difference between
the two of them,

25
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,310
you might think you want
the one on the left.

26
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,590
But you really want
the one on the right,

27
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,590
and I'll explain why.

28
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,810
The 2007 quiz was drawn,
roughly similarly, to this.

29
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,860
Although if you somehow wind up
in tutorial or somewhere else

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,930
doing one of the older
quizzes, a lot of them

31
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,040
were drawn exactly like this.

32
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,650
In this representation, one
thing I really don't like,

33
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,900
is that the inputs are
called x's, and the outputs

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,330
are called y's, but there's
two x's, so the inputs are not

35
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,690
x and y, and then they often
correspond to x's of a graph,

36
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,720
and then people get confused.

37
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,980
Additional issues
that many people have

38
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,880
are the fact that the summation
and the multiplication

39
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,190
with the weight is implied.

40
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,780
The weights are written on the
edges, where outputs and inputs

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,390
go, and the summation of
the two inputs into the node

42
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,540
are also implied.

43
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,970
But take a look here.

44
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,560
This is the same net.

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:17,500
These w's here would be
the w's that are written

46
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,610
onto these lines are here.

47
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,450
Actually the better
way to draw it

48
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:32,380
would be like so,
since each of these

49
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,760
can have their own w,
which is different.

50
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,730


51
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,020
So each of the w's
that are down here,

52
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,250
are being explicitly
set to a multiplier.

53
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,470
Where as here, you
just had to remember

54
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,700
to multiply the weight by
the input that was coming by.

55
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,260
Here you see an input,
comes to a multiplier,

56
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,180
you multiply by the weight,
then once you multiplied

57
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,410
all the inputs by the weight,
then you send them to a sum,

58
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,870
so the sigma is just a
sum, you sum them, add them

59
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,910
all together, send the result of
that into the sigmoid function,

60
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,330
our old buddy, 1 over 1 plus
e to the negative whatever

61
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,900
our input was, with a
weight for an offset,

62
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,740
and then we send
the result of that

63
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:26,520
into more multipliers with
more weights, more sums, more

64
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,360
sigmoids.

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,340
So this is how it's going
to look like on the quiz.

66
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:41,610
And this is a conversion
guide from version 0.9 data

67
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,940
into version 1.0.

68
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,060
So if you see
something that looks

69
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,610
like this, on one of the old
quizzes that you're doing,

70
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,980
see if you can convert it,
and then solve the problem.

71
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,735
Chances are if you
can convert it,

72
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,110
you're probably
going to do fine.

73
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:01,970


74
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,550
We'll start off not only
with this conversion guide,

75
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:17,839
but also-- I'll leave
that up here-- also

76
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,310
I'm going to work out the
formulas for you guys one more

77
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,230
time.

78
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,500
These are all the
formulae that you're

79
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,100
going to need on the quiz.

80
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,700
And then we're
going to decide what

81
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,480
will change in the formulae,
if, and this is a very

82
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,230
likely if, there seems to
be good amount of times

83
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,820
that this happens, is that
the sigmoid function in those

84
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,530
neurons out there
was ever changed

85
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,050
into some other
kind of function.

86
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,550
Hint.

87
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,460
It's changed into a plus
already in the problem

88
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,800
we're about to do.

89
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,420
People change it all the time
into some bizarro function.

90
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,680
I've seen arc tangent, I think.

91
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,910
So here we go.

92
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,160
Let's look at the front of it.

93
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,220
First of all, sigmoid.

94
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,910
Well our old buddy, sigmoid,
I just said it a moment ago,

95
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,275
sigmoid is 1 over 1
plus e to the minus x.

96
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:18,330


97
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:34,940
Also, fun fact about sigmoid,
the derivative of sigmoid,

98
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:41,210
is itself-- the
derivative of sigmoid

99
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:47,250
is-- let's say that the
sigmoid-- we'll just

100
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:53,001
turn sigmoid into
like the letter say y.

101
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:54,670
Y is the result, right?

102
00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:02,650
So if you say y equals 1 over
1 plus e to the negative x,

103
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:09,480
then the derivative of
sigmoid is y times 1 minus y.

104
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,330


105
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,740
You can also write out
the whole nasty thing,

106
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,380
it's 1 over 1 plus e to the
negative x times 1 minus 1

107
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,780
over 1 plus e to negative x.

108
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,820
So the nice property
of sigmoid it's

109
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,160
going to be important for
us in the very near future,

110
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,900
and that future begins now.

111
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,790
So now the performance function.

112
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,785
This is a function we used
to tell neural nets when

113
00:06:38,785 --> 00:06:42,700
they inevitably act up and
give us really crappy results.

114
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,510
At first we tell them
just how long they are,

115
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,430
with our performance function.

116
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,060
The first function can
be any sane function

117
00:06:53,060 --> 00:07:01,980
that gives you a better score,
where better can be decided

118
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,991
as lower or higher, if you feel
like, that gives you a better

119
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:08,240
score, if your answers are
closer to the answer you're

120
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,920
looking for.

121
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:17,360
However, in this case, we
have, for a very sneaky reason,

122
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,300
chosen the performance
function to be

123
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:27,530
1/2 d, which is the
desired output, minus o,

124
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,680
the actual output squared.

125
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,770


126
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,900
So we want a small,
well it's negative,

127
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,450
So we want a small
negative or 0.

128
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,130
That would mean
we performed well.

129
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:47,915
So why this?

130
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:50,560


131
00:07:50,560 --> 00:08:05,090
Well the main reason
is ddx of performance

132
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,450
is, the 2 comes down, the o
is the variable that we're

133
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:16,930
actually, so maybe I should say
ddo, that negative comes out,

134
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:22,340
we get a simple d minus o.

135
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,980


136
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,370
And yeah, we're using
derivatives here.

137
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,049
So those are fine.

138
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,620
These are two assumptions.

139
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,493
They could be
changed on your test.

140
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:37,909
We're going to figure out what
happens, if we change them,

141
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:41,440
if we change the performance,
if we change the sigmoid, that

142
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,927
is if we change the sigmoid
to some other function, what's

143
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:47,010
going to happen to the
next three functions, which

144
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,920
are basically the only
things that you need

145
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,410
to know to do backpropagation.

146
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,880
So let's look at that.

147
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,210
First, w prime.

148
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,820
This is the formula
for a new weight.

149
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,520
After one step of
backpropagation.

150
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,490
A new weight in any
of these positions

151
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:07,370
that you can see up here on
this beautiful neural net.

152
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,670
That w-- each of the w's will
have to change step by step.

153
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,330
That's, in fact, how you do
the hill climbing neural nets.

154
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,635
You change the
weights incrementally.

155
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:19,000
You step a little
bit in the direction

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,170
towards giving you your desired
results until eventually, you

157
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,100
hope, you have an
intelligent neural net.

158
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,265
And maybe you have many
different training examples

159
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:32,140
that you run it on,
in a cycle, hoping

160
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,980
that you don't over fit to
your one sample, on a computer.

161
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,510
But on the test, we will
probably will not do that.

162
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,750
So let's take a look
at how you calculate

163
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,060
the weights for the next level.

164
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,570
And then you have the weights
for the current level.

165
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,080
So first things first.

166
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,810
New weight, weight
prime equals--

167
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,500
starts with the old weight.

168
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,110
That has to go there
because otherwise we're

169
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,910
just going to jump off
somewhere at random.

170
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,010
We want to make a little
step in some direction,

171
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,250
so we want to start where
we are, with the weight.

172
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:08,720
And then we're going
to add three things.

173
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,050
So if we're talking
about the weight

174
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:17,390
between some i and
some j-- there's

175
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,190
some examples of the
names of weights.

176
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,240
So this is w 1 i, that's
the weight between 1

177
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,332
and-- so this is w 1 a, it's
the weight between 1 and a.

178
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:34,920
This is w 2 b, which is the
weight between 2 and b .

179
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,170
Makes sense?

180
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,270
Well makes sense
so far, but what

181
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,430
if it's just called
w b, then it's

182
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,279
the weight between-- these
w's that only have one letter,

183
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,070
we'll get to later.

184
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:47,930
They're the bias.

185
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,560
They're the offset.

186
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,020
They are always attached
to a negative 1.

187
00:10:52,020 --> 00:11:00,520
So you can pretty much treat
them as being a negative 1

188
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,840
here, that is then fed into
a multiplier with this w b,

189
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,673
if you like.

190
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:10,880


191
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,370
This is implied to be that.

192
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,920
All of the offsets are
implied to be that.

193
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:24,130
So w plus sum of alpha--
why is this Greek letter?

194
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,240
Where does it come from?

195
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,320
How do we calculate it?

196
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,149
Well alpha is just some value
told to you on the quiz.

197
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,190
You'll find it somewhere.

198
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,810
There's no way you're going
to have to calculate alpha.

199
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,090
You might be asked to
try to give us an alpha,

200
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,530
but probably not.

201
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,660
Alpha is supposed to give
the size of our little steps

202
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,650
that we take when we're
doing hill climbing.

203
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,600
Very large alpha,
take a huge step.

204
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,410
Very small alpha,
take tentative steps.

205
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,250
So alpha is there, basically,
to change this answer

206
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,900
and to make the new value either
very close to w, or far from w,

207
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,770
depending on our taste.

208
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:14,250
So plus alpha times
i, so i is the value

209
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:23,999
coming in into the node.

210
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:25,290
We're changing the weight here.

211
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:30,870
So i is the value, for
instance, i sub 1 here,

212
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:36,080
i would be the value of WAC,
i would be the value coming

213
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,170
output of node a.

214
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,600
WBC, i would be the
output of node b.

215
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,630
i is sometimes as little
as i is the input coming in

216
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,140
to meet that weight
at the multiplier.

217
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:56,700
And then it's
multiplied by delta j.

218
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,560
Your delta is the
delta that belongs

219
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,200
to these neural net nodes.

220
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,160
What is a delta, you said?

221
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,420
Funny you may ask.

222
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,222
It is a strange Greek letter.

223
00:13:07,222 --> 00:13:08,930
It sort of comes from
the fact that we're

224
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,638
doing some partial
derivatives and stuff,

225
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:13,335
but the main way you're going to
figure out what the deltas are

226
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:17,040
are these two formulae that
I've not written in yet.

227
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,970
So hold off on
trying to figure out

228
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,033
what the delta is until--
well right now, I'm

229
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:26,710
about to tell you the delta is.

230
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,670
So the delta is basically,
think of the delta

231
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,870
as using partial
derivatives to figure out

232
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,590
which way you're
going to step, when

233
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,940
you're doing hill climbing.

234
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,981
Because you know when
you're doing hill climbing,

235
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:42,090
you look around, you
figure out, OK, this

236
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,320
is the direction of
the highest increase,

237
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,980
and then you step off
in that direction.

238
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,720
So the deltas are
telling you which way

239
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,270
to step, with the weights.

240
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:55,480
And the way they do that is by
taking the partial derivative

241
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,460
of-- basically you
try to figure out

242
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,320
how the weight that you're
currently looking at

243
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,470
is contributing to the
performance of the net.

244
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,064
Contributing to, either
the good performance

245
00:14:10,064 --> 00:14:11,980
of the net, or the bad
performance of the net.

246
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,630


247
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:21,330
So when you're dealing with
the weights, like WBC, WAC,

248
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:27,090
that pretty much directly
feed into the end of the net.

249
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,330
They feed into the last
node, and it then comes out.

250
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,990
It's the output.

251
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,590
That's pretty easy.

252
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,270
You can tell exactly
how much those weights,

253
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,440
and the values coming from them,
are contributing to the end.

254
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,950
And we do that by
essentially, remember

255
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:53,120
what the partial derivative,
so partial derivative here

256
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,240
is, in fact, the way that the
final weights are contributing

257
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,850
to the performance, is just
the performance function.

258
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,160
Partial derivative--
I've already

259
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,830
figured out the derivative
here, it's just d minus o.

260
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,800


261
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,490
This is for sort
of final weights,

262
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,670
the weights in the last level.

263
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,790
D minus o, except
we're not done yet,

264
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,560
because when we do derivatives,
remember the chain rule.

265
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,330
To get from the end to these
weights, we pass through,

266
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,540
well it should be a
sigmoid, here it's not,

267
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,730
we're going to pretend
it is for the moment,

268
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,580
we pass through a
sigmoid, and since we

269
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,420
passed through the
sigmoid, we had better

270
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,050
take the derivative of
the sigmoid function.

271
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:46,700
That is, y times 1 minus y.

272
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,510
Well what is y?

273
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,150
What is the output
of the sigmoid?

274
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,970
It's up.

275
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,520
So that's also multiplied
by o times 1 minus o.

276
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:02,667


277
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:05,480
However, there is
a-- let me see,

278
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,780
let me see, yes-- sorry, I'm
carefully studying this sheet

279
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,000
to make sure my
nomenclature is exactly

280
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,120
right for our new nomenclature,
which so new and brave,

281
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,510
that we're doing it, that
we only knew for sure we're

282
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,450
going to do it on Wednesday.

283
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,160
So we have d minus o
times o times 1 minus o.

284
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,100


285
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:35,440
So you say, that's fine,
that can get us these weights

286
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,300
here, even this w
c, how are we going

287
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:48,070
to get the deltas for
the new weights here?

288
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,330


289
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:55,870
Oh, I realize-- yeah, I got it.

290
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,860
So the delta-- by the
way, this is a delta c,

291
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,980
how is neuron c
contributing to the output?

292
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,020
Well it's directly
contributing to the output ,

293
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,819
and it's got a sigmoid in it.

294
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,290
It doesn't really, but we're
pretending it does for now.

295
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,440
d minus o times 1 minus o.

296
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,329
What about inner node?

297
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:15,780
Node d, node a, what are
we going to have to do?

298
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,329
Well the way they
contribute to the output is

299
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,819
that they contribute to node c.

300
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,170
So we can do this
problem recursively.

301
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,680
So let's do this recursively.

302
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,080
First of all, as you have
probably figured out,

303
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,880
all of them are going to have
an o times 1 minus o factoring

304
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,570
from the chain rule, because
they're all sigmoid, pretending

305
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,653
that they're all sigmoids.

306
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:39,430


307
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,440
We also have a dearth
of good problems

308
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,800
that are actually sigmoid
on the web right now.

309
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,990
There's only 2007.

310
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,800
But here's o times
1 minus o, what

311
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,070
are we going to do
for the rest of it?

312
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,770
How does it contribute
to our final result?

313
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:00,460
Well it contributes to our
final result recursively.

314
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,920
So we're talking about delta i.

315
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,930
I is an inner node.

316
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,740
It's not a final node.

317
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,390
It's somewhere along the way.

318
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:24,500
So sum over j of w, going
from i to j, times delta j.

319
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:32,000
Now sum over all j, j
such that i leads to j.

320
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,860
I needs to have a
direct path into j.

321
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,830
So if i, in this
instance, was j,

322
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:45,240
everyone, the only possible
j in this would be c.

323
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,170
That's right.

324
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,940
We would not sum over
b as one of the j.

325
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,620
i does not lead to b, or a does
not lead to b, a only leads

326
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,470
to c.

327
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,820
Also note that c does
not need to be here.

328
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,860
That's going backwards.

329
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,760
So you just-- to figure out
which j you're looking at,

330
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,430
look directly forwards
at the next one.

331
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,030
So if there was another d here,
or that a does not go to d,

332
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,262
a goes to c.

333
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:15,970
You only look at the
next level children,

334
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:20,890
and you sum over
all those children,

335
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,050
the weight between
them, multiplied

336
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,040
by the child's delta.

337
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,440
That makes sense, right?

338
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,180
Because the way we affect, if
the child's delta is the way

339
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,850
the child affects the output,
calling these children

340
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,042
for a moment, and then
if this one directly

341
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,750
affects the output,
then the way this one

342
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:44,290
affects it is-- it affects
it because it affects this,

343
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,960
but it's also multiplied
by it's weight.

344
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,440
So in fact, for instance, if the
weight between a and c were 0,

345
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,690
then a doesn't affect
the output at all, right?

346
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:00,600
Because its weight is 0,
and when we do this problem,

347
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,010
we go this times 0, and then
we try to add it in there,

348
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,510
doesn't affect anything.

349
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,620
It's weight is very high,
it's going to really

350
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:14,280
dominate c, and that is
taken into account here,

351
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,090
and then multiply by the
delta for the right node.

352
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,800
So the following
question, and since I

353
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,610
spent a lot of time with
formulae and not that much time

354
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,650
starting on the problem, I will
not call on someone at random,

355
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,152
but rather take a volunteer.

356
00:20:32,152 --> 00:20:33,910
If no one volunteers,
I'll eventually

357
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,530
tell you, which is, we've
got some nice formulae

358
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,970
on the bottom three.

359
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,140
If we change the sigmoid
function, what has to change?

360
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:50,770


361
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,560
That's the only
thing that changes

362
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,000
in this crazy assed problem
right here, which by the way,

363
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,820
changes the sigmoid
functions into adders,

364
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,690
is that we take all
of the o times 1

365
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,440
minus o in delta
f and the delta i,

366
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,750
and we change it to
a new derivative.

367
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,850
We then do the exact same
thing that we would've done.

368
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,650
Correct.

369
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,040
And on a similar note, if
you change the performance

370
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,090
function, how many
of these equations

371
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,770
at all have to change
out of the bottom three.

372
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,360


373
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,070
Yeah.

374
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,430
That's right, just
one, just delta f.

375
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,480
Take the d minus o, make
it the new derivative

376
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,390
of the new performance function.

377
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,920
And in fact, delta i
doesn't change at all.

378
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,220
Does everyone see that?

379
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,530
Because it is very common
for something to be replaced,

380
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,670
I think three of the four
the quizzes that we have,

381
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,190
replaced in some-- changed
something in some way.

382
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,690
All right.

383
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,620
Let's go.

384
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,690
We're going to do
2008 quiz, because it

385
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,710
has a part of the end
that screwed up everyone,

386
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,510
and so let's make sure
we get to that part.

387
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,593
That's going to be the
part that you probably care

388
00:21:53,593 --> 00:21:54,920
about the most at this point.

389
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,050
So these are all adders
instead of sigmoids.

390
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:03,180
That means that they simply
add up everything as normal,

391
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,960
for a normal neural
net, and then there's

392
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,070
no sigmoid threshold.

393
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,710
They just give
some kind of value.

394
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,450
Question?

395
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,354
STUDENT: So we talked about
those multiplier things,

396
00:22:11,354 --> 00:22:14,750
we don't have those in nodes?

397
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,940
PROFESSOR: They're
not neural net nodes.

398
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:22,020
That is one of the reasons
why that other form that you

399
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,940
can see over there is elegant.

400
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,720
It only has the
actual nodes on it.

401
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,970
It is very compact.

402
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,210
It's one of the front we've
used in the previous tests.

403
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:35,020
The question is, do those
multipliers count as nodes?

404
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,110
However by not putting
in the multipliers,

405
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,410
we feel it sometimes confuses
people of explicitness.

406
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,410
The ones that are
nodes will always

407
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,230
have a label, like
a or here, you see

408
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,240
there's a sigmoid and an L1.

409
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,490
The multipliers are there
for your convenience,

410
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,310
to remind you to
multiply, and also

411
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,650
those, if you look those
sigmoids that are over there,

412
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,330
are there for your convenience
to remind you to add.

413
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,850
In fact, the only
thing that counts

414
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,636
as a node in the
neural net-- and that's

415
00:23:04,636 --> 00:23:07,810
a very good question--
is usually the sigmoids,

416
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,382
here it's the adders.

417
00:23:10,382 --> 00:23:12,090
We've essentially
taken out the sigmoids.

418
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:17,370
These adders are the-- oh,
here's the way to tell.

419
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:22,010
If it's got a threshold
weight associated with it,

420
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,200
then it's one of
the actual nodes.

421
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,220
A threshold weight.

422
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,428
I guess the multipliers look
like they have a weight,

423
00:23:28,428 --> 00:23:31,774
but this is just the weight
that is being multiplied in.

424
00:23:31,774 --> 00:23:33,940
This is our witness be
multiplied in with the input,

425
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,973
but if it has a threshold
weight, like wa,

426
00:23:35,973 --> 00:23:38,030
wb-- oh, I promised
I would tell you guys

427
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,760
the difference between
the two weights.

428
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,960
So let's do that very quickly.

429
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,860
The kinds of weights that,
say w2b or w1a, our weight the

430
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:51,775
comes between input
1 and a or between a

431
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:57,590
and c, then mentally multiplying
the input by this weight,

432
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,840
and then eventually
that's added together.

433
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,040
The threshold weights, they
just have like wb, wa, wc.

434
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,900
They are essentially to decide
the threshold for a success

435
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,715
or failure, for a 1 or a
0, or anything in between,

436
00:24:14,715 --> 00:24:17,150
at any of the given nodes.

437
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,500
So the idea is maybe
you at some node

438
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,260
want to have a
really high cut off,

439
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,180
you have to very high value
coming in, or else it's a 0.

440
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,060
So you put a high threshold.

441
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,200
The weight is multiplied
by negative 1.

442
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:37,880
And in fact, the threshold
weight won't-- one could

443
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,850
consider if you wanted to that
the threshold weight times

444
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,030
negative 1. was also
added in it that sum,

445
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,560
instead of putting at the
same location as the node.

446
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,140
If that works better for you,
when you're converting it,

447
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,010
you can also think
of it that way.

448
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,090
Because the threshold
weight is essentially

449
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,650
multiplied by negative
1 and added in

450
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,130
at that same sum over there.

451
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,062
So that's another way to do it.

452
00:25:02,062 --> 00:25:04,270
There's a lot of ways to
visualize these neural nets.

453
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,940
Just make sure you have a
way that makes sense to you,

454
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,690
and that you can tell
pretty much whatever

455
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:12,050
we write, as long as it
looks vaguely like that,

456
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:15,159
how to get it in your mind,
into the representation

457
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:15,950
that works for you.

458
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,241
Because once you have the
representation right for you,

459
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:20,360
you're more than halfway
to solving these guys.

460
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,660
They aren't that bad.

461
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,080
They just look nasty.

462
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,310
They don't bite.

463
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,900
OK.

464
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,560
These are just adders.

465
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,570
So if it's just an
adder, then that

466
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:34,410
means that, if we take all
the x inputs coming in--

467
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,630
let's do x and y for the
moment, so we can figure out

468
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,980
the derivative--
then what comes out

469
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:46,830
after we just add up the x, what
comes out, y equals x, right?

470
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,770
We're just adding it up.

471
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:52,290
Adding up all the input, we're
not doing anything to it.

472
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,910
Y equals x is what
this node does.

473
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,790
You people see that?

474
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:00,690
So the derivative is just one.

475
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,590
So that's pretty easy, because
the first problem says,

476
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:10,850
what is the new
formula, delta f.

477
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,890
So I'll just tell you.

478
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,810
You guys probably
figured it out.

479
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,538
o times 1 minus o.

480
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:21,530
Because we replaced
d minus o with 1.

481
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,230
OK?

482
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,172
Makes sense so far?

483
00:26:23,172 --> 00:26:24,630
Please ask questions
along the way,

484
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,660
because I'm not going
to be asking you guys.

485
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,805
I'll do it myself.

486
00:26:27,805 --> 00:26:28,305
Question?

487
00:26:28,305 --> 00:26:29,888
STUDENT: Why to we
use d minus o of 1?

488
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,890


489
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,600
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

490
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,510
The reason is because
I did the wrong thing.

491
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:42,230
So see, it's good that you
guys are asking questions.

492
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,850
It actually should be replaced
with o times 1 minus o with 1.

493
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:49,350
The answer is delta
f equals d minus o.

494
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,170
So yes, perhaps I
did it to trick you.

495
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,570
No, I actually messed up.

496
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,820
But yes, please ask
questions along the way.

497
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,080
Again, I don't have
time to call on you guys

498
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,520
at random to figure out if
you guys are following along.

499
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,020
So I'll do it myself.

500
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,180
We're placing the o times
1 minus o with 1 because

501
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,860
of the fact that
the sigmoid is gone,

502
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,960
and we get just delta
f equals d minus o.

503
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,660
So great.

504
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:18,320
We now want to know what
the equation is for delta i,

505
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,720
at the node a.

506
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,740
So delta a.

507
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,270
Well let's take a look.

508
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,530
The o times 1 minus o is gone.

509
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:30,210
Now we just have the sum over
j, which you guys already

510
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:36,120
told me is, only c
of WAC times delta c.

511
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,350
We know that delta
c is d minus o.

512
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:43,590
The answer is delta a is
just WAC times d minus o.

513
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,050
That time, I got it right.

514
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,684
I see the answer here.

515
00:27:47,684 --> 00:27:49,600
Though it's written in
a very different format

516
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,290
from the old quiz.

517
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,590
Any questions on that?

518
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:58,070
Well that's part a that
we finished out of c.

519
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,300
Let's go to part b.

520
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,625
Part b is doing one
step backpropagation.

521
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:04,430
There's almost always going
to be one of these in here.

522
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,740
So the first thing it
asks is to figure out

523
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,510
what the output o is
for this neural net

524
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:15,670
if all weights are initially 1
except that this guy right here

525
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:18,120
is negative 0.5.

526
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,120
All the other ones
start off as 1.

527
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,560
Let's do a step-- oh, let's
see what are the inputs.

528
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,040
The inputs are also all 1.

529
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,320
Desired output is also 1.

530
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:37,980
And in fact, the rate
constant alpha is also 1.

531
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,490
This is the only thing
that isn't 1, folks.

532
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,070
So let's see what happens.

533
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:48,210
1 times 1 is 1, then
this is a negative 1

534
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,870
times 1 is negative 1.

535
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,062
That's 0.

536
00:28:53,062 --> 00:28:55,520
The exact same thing happens
here because it's symmetrical.

537
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,546
So these are both 0.

538
00:28:57,546 --> 00:29:03,150
0 times 1 is 0, 0 times 1 is 0.

539
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:07,770
Then this is negative 1 times
negative 0.5 is positive 0.5,

540
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:14,740
so 0 plus 0 plus a positive
0.5, the output is positive 0.5.

541
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,700
Does everyone see that?

542
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,830
If not, you can
convince yourself

543
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,900
that it is positive 0.5.

544
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,570
That would be a good
exercise for you,

545
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,470
run through one forward run.

546
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,650
The output is
definitely positive 0.5.

547
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,000
First time around.

548
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,130
OK?

549
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,000
Now we have to do one
step of backpropagation.

550
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,900
To do that, let's
calculate all the delta

551
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,810
so that we can calculate
all the new weights,

552
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,560
the the new weight primes.

553
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,660
So delta c.

554
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,490
That's easy.

555
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,060
You guys can tell
me what delta c is.

556
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,440
We figured out what the
new delta c is going to be.

557
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,500
So simple addition or
subtraction problem?

558
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,306
Everyone, delta c is?

559
00:29:52,306 --> 00:29:53,000
STUDENT: 0.5.

560
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,086
PROFESSOR: 0.5, one half, yes.

561
00:29:58,086 --> 00:29:58,585
All right.

562
00:29:58,585 --> 00:30:02,250


563
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:07,690
We know that delta a and delta
b are just WAC times delta c,

564
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,150
and WBC times delta c.

565
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,660
So they are?

566
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,460
STUDENT: One half.

567
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,440
PROFESSOR: Also one half,
because all the weights were 1.

568
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,970


569
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:17,750
Easy street.

570
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,600
OK.

571
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,980
We've got all of the
deltas are one half.

572
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,290
And all but a few of
the weights are 1.

573
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,190
So let's figure out what
the new weights are.

574
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:29,910


575
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,140
New WAC, OK.

576
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:37,520


577
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,320
Yeah, so let's see.

578
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,480
What's going to be the new WAC?

579
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,080
So the new WAC is
going to be old

580
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,880
WAC, which is 1, because all
of them are 1 except for wc,

581
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,960
plus the rate constant which
is 1, times the input coming

582
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,270
in here, but
remember that was 0,

583
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:01,500
so actually it's just going
to be the same as the old WAC.

584
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,000
This is a metrical problem
between b and a, at the moment,

585
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,720
this is going to be the same.

586
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,407
All right.

587
00:31:09,407 --> 00:31:10,990
Somethings are going
to change though.

588
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,960
What about wc, that was the
one that was actually not 1?

589
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,610
OK.

590
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:25,120
So new wc, remember,
the i for wc,

591
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,720
the i that we use
in this equation

592
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,680
is always negative 1
because it's a threshold.

593
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:37,700
So we have the old wc, which
is negative 0.5, plus 1 times

594
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,990
negative 1 times delta
c, which is one half.

595
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:49,330
So we have negative 0.5 plus
negative 0.5 equals negative 1.

596
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:57,260
w 1 a, well we've got
w 1 a starts out as 1.

597
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:04,180
Then we also know
that w 1 a is going

598
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,090
to be equal to 1 plus 1
times the input, which

599
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:18,420
is 1, times delta of a,
which is one half, so 1.5.

600
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:25,000
And since it's symmetrical
between a and b, then w 2

601
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,400
b is also 1.5.

602
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:35,730
And then finally, wa and wb,
the offsets here, well they

603
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:41,250
start at 1 plus 1 times
negative 1 times 0.5.

604
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,150
So they're both, everyone?

605
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:44,947
STUDENT: One half.

606
00:32:44,947 --> 00:32:45,780
PROFESSOR: One half.

607
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,321
That's right.

608
00:32:46,321 --> 00:32:55,330


609
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,080
That's right.

610
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,780
Because negative 1 is their i.

611
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:05,440
Negative 1 times one half plus
positive 1 is just one half.

612
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,690
That's one full step.

613
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,180
Maybe a mite easier than
you might be used to seeing,

614
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,386
but there's a full step.

615
00:33:11,386 --> 00:33:13,510
And it asks what's going
to be the output after one

616
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,509
step of backpropagation?

617
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:16,300
We can take a look.

618
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,860


619
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:26,280
So we have 1 times the new wa,
which is 1.5, you've got 1.5,

620
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,130
then the new wa is
just 0.5, now is

621
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,920
0.5, that's a 1
coming into an adder.

622
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,910
We've got another 1 coming in
here because it's symmetrical.

623
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:39,370
So 1 and a 1, 1 times WAC is 1.

624
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,020
1 times WBC is 1.

625
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,990
So we have two 1s coming in
here, they're added, that's 2.

626
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:50,860
Then this has become negative
1, in fact, at this point.

627
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:55,970
So negative 1 times negative 1,
that's 3, and the output is 3.

628
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,540


629
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,070
All right.

630
00:33:59,070 --> 00:33:59,590
Cool.

631
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:03,880
We've now finished part b, which
is over half of everything.

632
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,186
Oh no, we've not.

633
00:34:05,186 --> 00:34:05,810
One more thing.

634
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,929


635
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:11,690
These are adders.

636
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,565
They're not sigmoids.

637
00:34:12,565 --> 00:34:16,210


638
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,095
What if we train this
entire neural net

639
00:34:19,095 --> 00:34:21,389
to try to learn this
data, so that it

640
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:25,520
can draw a line on a
graph, or draw some lines,

641
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,199
or do some kind of learning,
to separate off the minuses

642
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,070
from all the pluses.

643
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,280
You've seen, maybe,
and if not, you

644
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,780
are about to in a
second, because it

645
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,600
asks you to do this in detail,
than neural nets can usually

646
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,830
draw one line on the
graph for each of these,

647
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,120
sort of, nodes in the net,
because each of the nodes

648
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,449
has some kind of threshold.

649
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:49,480
And you can do some logic
between them like ands or ors.

650
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,830
What do you guys think
this net is going to draw?

651
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,389
Anyone could volunteer,
I'm not going to ask anyone

652
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:58,260
to give this answer.

653
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,510
That's a little bit
tricky, because usually

654
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,890
if you had this many
nodes, you could easily

655
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,750
draw a box and box off the
minuses from the pluses.

656
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,680
However, it draws this.

657
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,350
And it asks what is the error?

658
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:16,570
The error is-- oh yeah, it even
tells you the error is 1/8,

659
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:19,260
because why?

660
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,660
These are all adders.

661
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,460
You can't actually
do anything logical.

662
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,760
This entire net boils
down to just one node,

663
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,530
because it just
adds up every time.

664
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,330
It never takes a
threshold at any point.

665
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:33,160
So you can't turn into
logical ones and zeroes,

666
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,440
because it's basically not
digital at all, its analog.

667
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,500
It's giving us some
very high number.

668
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,840
So it all boils
down to one cut off.

669
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,850
And that's the best one.

670
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,700
The one that I drew right here.

671
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,929
OK.

672
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:49,220
Did that not make sense to you?

673
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,280
That's OK.

674
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,080
This problem is much harder.

675
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,040
And putting them both on the
same quiz, was a bit brutal,

676
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,880
but by the time
you're done with this,

677
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,380
you'll understand what a
neural net can do or not.

678
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,840
I put these in simplified
form because of the fact

679
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,350
that we don't care about their
values or anything like that.

680
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:09,570
But inside of these little
circles is a sigmoid,

681
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:13,860
the multipliers and the
summers are implied.

682
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,380
I think in the simplified
form when we're not actually

683
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,590
doing backpropagation is
easier to view it, and see

684
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,950
how many nodes there are.

685
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,741
For the same reason
you asked your question

686
00:36:21,741 --> 00:36:22,850
about how many there are.

687
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:26,130
So all of those big
circles are node.

688
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,080
And in those nodes is a sigmoid
now, not those crazy adders.

689
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,680
We have the following problem.

690
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,590
We have to try to
match each of a,

691
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:37,690
b, c, d, e, f to 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, using each of them

692
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,100
only once.

693
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,140
That's important, because some
of the more powerful networks

694
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,730
in here can do a lot of these.

695
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,050
So it's like yes, the
powerful networks could

696
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,620
do some of the
easier problems here,

697
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,940
but we want to match each
net to a problem it can do,

698
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,720
and there is exactly one
mapping that will map-- that

699
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,290
is one to one, and maps exactly,
uses all six of the nets

700
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,700
to solve all six of
these problems here.

701
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,030
So some of you may
be going like, what?

702
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,870
How am I going to
solve these problems?

703
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,490
I gave away a hint
before, which is

704
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:16,940
that each node in the neural
net, each sigmoid node

705
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:21,070
can usually draw
one line on the-- it

706
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,290
can draw one line
into the picture.

707
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,225
The line can be
diagonal if that nodes

708
00:37:25,225 --> 00:37:28,320
receives both of the inputs,
which is here, i 1 and i 2.

709
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,470
See there is an i
1 and an i 2 axis.

710
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,330
Like x- and a y-axis.

711
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:36,420
The node has to be horizontal,
or vertical, if-- sorry,

712
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,920
the line has to be horizontal
or vertical if the node only

713
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,810
receives one of the inputs.

714
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:46,560
And then, if you
have a deeper level,

715
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,090
these secondary level nodes
can sort of do a logical,

716
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,810
can do some kind of brilliant
thing like and or or of

717
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:58,020
the first two, which
can help you out.

718
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,770
All right.

719
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,530
And so let's try
to figure it out.

720
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:05,030
So right off the bat, and I hope
that people will help and call

721
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,930
this out, because
I know we don't

722
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,305
have enough time that I can
force you guys to all get it.

723
00:38:09,305 --> 00:38:11,013
But right off the bat,
which one of these

724
00:38:11,013 --> 00:38:12,699
looks like it's the easiest one?

725
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:13,240
STUDENT: Six.

726
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,865
PROFESSOR: Six.

727
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:14,530
That's great.

728
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,946
Six is definitely
the easiest one.

729
00:38:15,946 --> 00:38:17,220
It's a single line.

730
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,430
So this is just how I would
have solved this problem,

731
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,530
is find the easiest one.

732
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,010
Which of these is
the crappiest net?

733
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:23,510
STUDENT: A.

734
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,500
PROFESSOR: A is
the crappiest net.

735
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,440
But there's no
way in hell that A

736
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,510
is going to be able to get
any of these except for six.

737
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:39,240
So let's, right off the bat,
say that six is A. All right.

738
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:44,550
Six is A. That's A. We don't
have to worry about A. OK.

739
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,560
Cool.

740
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,400
Now let's look at some other
ones that are very interesting.

741
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,430
All the rest of
these draw two lines,

742
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,835
well these three draw two lines.

743
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:55,380
These three draw three lines.

744
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,800
They draw a triangle.

745
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,740
So despite the fact that this
c is a very powerful node,

746
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:09,470
that indeed, with three whole
levels here of sigmoids,

747
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,400
it looks like there's
only two that's

748
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,490
in our little stable of
nets that are equipped

749
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,460
to handle number one and two.

750
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,530
And those are?

751
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:23,335
E and F, because E and F have
three nodes at the first level.

752
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:25,276
They can draw three lines.

753
00:39:25,276 --> 00:39:27,650
And then they can do something
logical about those lines,

754
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:31,690
like for instance, maybe, if
it's inside all of those lines.

755
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,960
There's a way to do that.

756
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,260
You just-- basically you can
give negative and positive

757
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,120
weights as you so
choose to make sure

758
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,264
that it's under certain
ones, above other ones,

759
00:39:40,264 --> 00:39:42,930
and then make the threshold such
that it has to follow all three

760
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,160
of your rules.

761
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,725
So between E and F,
which one should be two

762
00:39:49,725 --> 00:39:52,050
and which one should be one.

763
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,160
Anyone see?

764
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,140
Well let's look at two and one.

765
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,790
Which one is easier to do?

766
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,880
Between two and one.

767
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,120
Two.

768
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,820
It's got a horizontal
and a vertical.

769
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,350
One has all three diagonal.

770
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:08,262
And which one of these is a
weaker net, between E and F.

771
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:10,620
F. F has one node that
can only do a horizontal,

772
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,630
and one node that can
only do a vertical line.

773
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,370
So which one is F
going to have to do?

774
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,850
Two.

775
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,210
And E does what?

776
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:20,530
Good job, guys.

777
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,470
Good job, you got this.

778
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,940
So now let's look
at the last three.

779
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:31,070


780
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,790
Number three is
definitely the hardest.

781
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:35,470
It's an exceller.

782
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,260
Those of you who've
played around

783
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,750
with double o 2 kind of
stuff, or even just logic,

784
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:45,560
probably know that
there is no way

785
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:52,490
to make a sort of simple
linear combination in one

786
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,610
level of logic to
create an x or.

787
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:58,660
x or is very
difficult to create.

788
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,830
There are some
interesting problems

789
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:04,560
involving trying to teach
an exceller to a neural net.

790
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,280
Because a neural
net is not to be

791
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,720
able to get the x or, because of
the fact that you can tell it,

792
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,120
OK, I want this one to be
high, and this one to be low.

793
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,930
That's fine.

794
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,610
You say these both
have to be high.

795
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,620
That's fine.

796
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,110
It's hard to say, it's pretty
much impossible to say,

797
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:24,860
this one or this one, but
not the other, because need

798
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,460
to be high in a single node,
because of the fact that if you

799
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,460
just play with it, you'll see.

800
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,470
You need to set a
threshold somewhere,

801
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,680
and it's not going to
be able to distinguish

802
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,325
between, if the threshold
is set such that the

803
00:41:36,325 --> 00:41:38,450
or is going to work, the
whole or is going to work.

804
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:42,060
It's going to accept when both
of them are positive as well.

805
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,360
So how we can do x or?

806
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,730
We need more logic.

807
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,990
We need to use some
combinations of ands and ors

808
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,480
in a two level way.

809
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,520
To do that we need the deepest
neural net that we have.

810
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,390
There's only one
that's capable of that.

811
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,680
And that is?

812
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,785
It's C.

813
00:41:55,785 --> 00:41:57,410
There are many
different ways to do it.

814
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,510
Let's think of a possibility.

815
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:04,230
i 1 and i 2 draw
these two lines.

816
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,450
Let's call these one,
two, three, four, five,

817
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:12,010
node 1 and node 2
draw these two lines.

818
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:14,680
And I'll just sort of
draw it here for you guys.

819
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,050
Then maybe node 3
gives value to-- yeah,

820
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:29,810
let me see-- node three can
give value to perhaps-- let's

821
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:36,924
see-- node 3 can give value to
everything that is-- there are

822
00:42:36,924 --> 00:42:38,090
a lot of possibilities here.

823
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:48,410
Node 3 can give value to
everything that is up here.

824
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,650
Actually node 3 can
give value to everything

825
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:56,630
except for this
bottom part, and then

826
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:05,510
node 4 could give value to
say-- doesn't do it yet,

827
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:07,700
but there's a few-- there's
a few different ways

828
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,130
to do it if you played around.

829
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,470
The key idea is that
node 3 and node 4

830
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:17,350
can give value to some
combination and or or not,

831
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:23,490
and then node 5 can give value
based on being above or below

832
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:26,280
a certain threshold,
combination of 3 and 4.

833
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,200
You can build an exceller
out of the logic gates.

834
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,820
I will ponder on that in the
back burner for a moment,

835
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,200
as we continue
onward, but clearly C

836
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,010
has to do number three.

837
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:38,620
OK.

838
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,490
Now we're left
with four and five.

839
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,447
I think, interestingly,
five looks

840
00:43:42,447 --> 00:43:45,030
like it may be more complicated
than four, because of the fact

841
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,297
that it needs to do both
different directions instead

842
00:43:48,297 --> 00:43:49,570
of two of the same direction.

843
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:52,930


844
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,720
So however, just the idea of
the one with the fewer lines,

845
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,720
being a simpler one, may
not get us through here.

846
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,860
And there's a reason why.

847
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,180
Look what we have left to use.

848
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:06,610
We have to use D or B. What is
the property of the two lines

849
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,740
that D can draw?

850
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,930
D being the simpler one.

851
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,760
One horizontal, one
vertical, that's right.

852
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,260
So even though it
may look simpler

853
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,740
to just have two
horizontal lines,

854
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,860
it actually requires B.
B is the only one that

855
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,030
can draw two horizontal lines
because D has to draw one

856
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,660
horizontal and one vertical.

857
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:33,160
So that leaves us with,
B on this, D on this.

858
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,410
Excellent, we have a question.

859
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,327
I would've thought it
would have been possible

860
00:44:36,327 --> 00:44:37,743
that we had no
questions, or maybe

861
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:39,471
I just explained it
the best I ever have.

862
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:39,970
Question.

863
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:43,825
STUDENT: I didn't get why B
has to be two horizontal lines.

864
00:44:43,825 --> 00:44:44,700
PROFESSOR: All right.

865
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,450
So the question is, I
don't understand why

866
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,200
B to be two horizontal lines.

867
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,340
The answer is, it doesn't.

868
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:56,510
B can be anything, but D
can't be two horizontal lines.

869
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,180
And so by process
of elimination,

870
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:03,680
it's B. Well take
a look at D, right.

871
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,530
So D has three nodes,
one, two, three.

872
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:12,660
Node 1 and node 2 can
just draw a line anywhere

873
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,140
they want, involving
the inputs they receive.

874
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:18,470
What input does node 1 receive?

875
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:19,280
Let's go to node 1.

876
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,910


877
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:26,550
So it can only make a
cut off based on i 1.

878
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:30,800
So therefore, it can only
draw by making the cut off

879
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,200
above and below a certain point.

880
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,990
Node 1 can only
draw vertical lines.

881
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:37,174
Node 2 can only draw
a horizontal line,

882
00:45:37,174 --> 00:45:38,590
because it can
only make a cut off

883
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:41,780
based on where it is an i 2.

884
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,390
Therefore they can't
both draw a horizontal.

885
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:46,640
That's why this is
the trickiest part.

886
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,160
This last part, because
B is more powerful.

887
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,340
B does not only have to
do two horizontal lines.

888
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,280
It can do two diagonal lines.

889
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,490
It can do anything it wants.

890
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:58,222
It just happens that it's stuck
doing this somewhat easier

891
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,680
problem, because the fact that
it is the only one left that

892
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,490
has the power to do it.

893
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:05,760
So let's see, we're
done, and we'd

894
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,490
have aced this part of the
quiz that like no one got,

895
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:11,240
well not no one, but
very few people got,

896
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,660
when we put it on in 2008.

897
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:17,140
The only thing we
have left to ask

898
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:22,430
is-- let me see-- yeah, the
only thing we have left to ask

899
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:29,931
is what are we going
to do here for this?

900
00:46:29,931 --> 00:46:30,430
All right.

901
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:31,070
Let's see.

902
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:33,860


903
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:38,360
For the x or, let's see
if I can do this x or.

904
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,360


905
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,240
OK.

906
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,970
How about this one.

907
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:45,510
Right.

908
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,180
I'm an idiot.

909
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,910
This is the easiest way.

910
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,926
Number one draws this line.

911
00:46:49,926 --> 00:46:51,050
Number two draws this line.

912
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:55,307
Number three ends the
line, the two lines.

913
00:46:55,307 --> 00:46:56,890
Number three says
only if both of them

914
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:58,360
are true, will I accept.

915
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:02,510
Number four maps the two lines.

916
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,550
And number five ors
between three and four.

917
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:08,430


918
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:09,740
Thank you.

919
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,840
No, it's not that hard.

920
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,902
I just completely
blanked, because there's

921
00:47:13,902 --> 00:47:15,860
another way that a lot
of people like to do it.

922
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,300
It involves drawing
in a lot of lines,

923
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,570
and then making the clef b 2.

924
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,280
But I can't remember
it at the moment.

925
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,610
Or there any other questions?

926
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:26,958
Because I think if you
have a question now,

927
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:28,582
like four other people
have it and just

928
00:47:28,582 --> 00:47:29,630
aren't raising their hand.

929
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,470
So ask any questions
about this drawing thing.

930
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:31,970
Question?

931
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,569
STUDENT: Why do we do this?

932
00:47:33,569 --> 00:47:35,360
PROFESSOR: Why do we
do this drawing thing?

933
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,680
That's a very good question.

934
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,990
The answer is so that you
can see what kinds of nets

935
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:43,680
you might need to use in
these simple problems,

936
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,590
to answer these simple problems.

937
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:51,320
So that if Athena
forbid that you

938
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,340
have to use a
neural net in a job

939
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,640
somewhere to do some
actual learning,

940
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,260
and you see some sort of
quality about the problem,

941
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,910
you know not to make a
net that's too simple,

942
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:03,720
for instance.

943
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,178
And you wouldn't
want a net that is

944
00:48:05,178 --> 00:48:06,660
more complex than it has to be.

945
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:10,840
So you can sort of see what
the net's do at each level,

946
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,140
and more visibly understand.

947
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,970
I think a lot of people who
drew problems like this just

948
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,595
want to make sure
people know, oh yeah,

949
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,636
it's not just these numbers
that we're mindlessly

950
00:48:19,636 --> 00:48:21,760
backpropagating from the
other part of the problem

951
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,720
to make them higher or lower.

952
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,760
This is what we're
doing at each level.

953
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,280
This is the space
that we're looking at.

954
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,780
Each node is performing
logic on the steps before.

955
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,680
So that if you actually have to
use a neural net later on, down

956
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,409
the road, then you'll
be able to figure out

957
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:43,200
what your net's going
to need to look like.

958
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,530
You'll be able to figure
out what it's doing.

959
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,174
At least as well as
you can figure out

960
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,590
what it's doing,
for a neural net,

961
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:50,950
since it often will
start getting up

962
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:54,070
these really crazy numbers, will
have all sorts of nodes in it,

963
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,981
and like a real neural net
that's being used nowadays,

964
00:48:56,981 --> 00:48:58,730
there'll be tons of
nodes, and you'll just

965
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,104
see the numbers
fluctuate wildly,

966
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:04,402
and then suddenly it's going
to start working or not.

967
00:49:04,402 --> 00:49:05,360
That's a good question.

968
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,193
Any other questions?

969
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,220
We still have a few minutes.

970
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,340
Not many, but a few.

971
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,564
Any other questions
about any of this stuff?

972
00:49:11,564 --> 00:49:12,064
Sorry.

973
00:49:12,064 --> 00:49:12,556
STUDENT: Talk about
what you just asked.

974
00:49:12,556 --> 00:49:15,016
Just because we draw it, does
the machine need to learn--

975
00:49:15,016 --> 00:49:20,929


976
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:23,220
PROFESSOR: You're confused
why the machine is run what,

977
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,140
by the pictures on the right?

978
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,137
Oh OK.

979
00:49:27,137 --> 00:49:29,720
Machine does not have to learn
by drawing pictures and calling

980
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,676
them in.

981
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,300
Let me give you some
real applications.

982
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,110
My friend at the
University of Maryland

983
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:38,300
recently actually
used neural nets

984
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,640
because, yeah, he actually did,
because of the fact that he

985
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,410
was doing an game plan
competition, where

986
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:48,795
the game was not known when
you were designing your AI.

987
00:49:48,795 --> 00:49:52,490
It had to be able to-- there was
some very elegant, general game

988
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,950
solver thing that you had
be able to hook up into,

989
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:58,140
and then they made up the
rules, and you had a little bit

990
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,570
of time, and then it started.

991
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:03,320
Some of the AI's, what
they did was, they trained,

992
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,780
once they found out what
the rules were on their own,

993
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,450
with the rules, in his case he
had a neural net, because it

994
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:11,660
was so generic, you just
have a web of random gook.

995
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,970
He thought it could
learn anything,

996
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,910
and then-- he never did tell
me how it went, probably

997
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:18,090
didn't go well.

998
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,700
But maybe it did.

999
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:25,119
It basically tried to learn
some things about the rules.

1000
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:26,660
Some of the other
people who are more

1001
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:29,930
principled game players
actually tried to find out

1002
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,950
fundamental properties
of the space of the rules

1003
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,820
by testing a few
different things,

1004
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,640
so they could view
more knowledge

1005
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,110
is less search so they
could do less search

1006
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,180
when the actual game
playing came on.

1007
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,390
And then when the actual
game playing came on,

1008
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:48,680
pretty much everyone did some
kind of game tree based stuff.

1009
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,640
He's telling me that
a lot of Monte Carlo

1010
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,340
based game tree stuff that is
this very non deterministic

1011
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,349
as what they're doing
nowadays, rather than

1012
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:59,140
what determines the
alpha beta, although he

1013
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,380
said it converges to alpha beta,
if you've given enough time.

1014
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,050
That's what he told
me, But that someone I

1015
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,570
know who is using neural nets.

1016
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,800
I've also in a cognitive
science class I took,

1017
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,720
saw neural nets that tried
to attach like qualities

1018
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,620
to objects, by having just
this huge, huge number of nodes

1019
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,160
in levels in between, and
then eventually it was like,

1020
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,780
a duck flies, and you're like,
how's it doing this again?

1021
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,640
I'm not sure, but it is.

1022
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,890
So the basic idea
is that when-- one

1023
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:28,140
of the main reasons that
neural nets were used so much

1024
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:31,340
back in the day is that
people on many different sides

1025
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,450
of this problem,
cognitive science, AI,

1026
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:35,620
whatever, were all
saying, wait a minute,

1027
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:38,610
there's networks of neurons,
and they can do stuff,

1028
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:40,360
and we're seeing it
in different places.

1029
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,860
And when you've seen it in so
many different places at once,

1030
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,490
must be a genius
idea that's going

1031
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,140
to revolutionize everything.

1032
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,780
And so then everyone
started using

1033
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,860
them to try to connect all these
things together, which I think

1034
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,340
is a noble endeavor,
but unfortunately people

1035
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,300
just stopped using it.

1036
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,180
It didn't work as they wanted.

1037
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,950
It turned out that figuring out
our neurons worked in our head

1038
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:03,860
was not the way to solve all
AI hard problems at once.

1039
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,360
And they fall into
disfavor, although are still

1040
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,510
used for some reasons,
like the sum is like that.

1041
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:11,610
So we wouldn't use it just
to draw these pictures.

1042
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,492
The reason why we
have these pictures

1043
00:52:13,492 --> 00:52:15,950
is because we give you simple
nets that you can work it out

1044
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:17,720
by hand on the quiz.

1045
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,340
Any net that is
really used nowadays

1046
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,700
would make your
head explode, if we

1047
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,140
tried to make you do
something with it on the quiz.

1048
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,660
It would just be horrible.

1049
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,315
So I think that's
a good question.

1050
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,440
If there's no other questions,
or even if they are,

1051
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,390
because we have to head out,
if there's any other questions,

1052
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:37,360
you can see me as
I'm walking out.
