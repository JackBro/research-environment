10
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:24,390
PROFESSOR: Today we're going
to be talking about games.

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,724
And I know you guys as
well as I hope I do.

12
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:32,140
The main thing that you guys
want to talk about with games

13
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,330
is how to do that
alpha-beta thing.

14
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,300
Because it's pretty confusing.

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,490
And it's easy to get lost
in a corner or something.

16
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,820
Whereas doing the regular
minimax, in my experience,

17
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,590
most 6034 students can do that.

18
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,450
And they do it right
pretty much all the time.

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,560
However, we're going to focus
on all the different components

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,940
of games.

21
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,910
And I put up two provocative
silver star ideas

22
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,370
up on the board, which
will come into play here.

23
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,840
The Snow White
principle is a new name.

24
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,489
And it has never been
revealed until today.

25
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,050
Because I made up name recently.

26
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,000
So you will be the first
people to hear it and decide

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,310
if it works better than
the term "grandfather

28
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,630
clause" for the thing that
I'm trying to describe.

29
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,420
Because most grandfathers
don't eat their children.

30
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:25,300
So here we've got a
beautiful game tree.

31
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,970
It has nodes from
A through R. This

32
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,250
is our standard
game tree from 6034.

33
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,922
We've got a maximizer
up at the top

34
00:01:35,922 --> 00:01:37,880
who's trying to get the
highest score possible.

35
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,770
The minimizer is her opponent.

36
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,530
And the minimizer is trying
to get to the lowest score

37
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,930
possible.

38
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,264
And it's really unclear who
wins or loses at each point.

39
00:01:49,264 --> 00:01:51,680
They're just trying to get it
to the highest or the lowest

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,140
score.

41
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,660
All right, so let's
do a refresher.

42
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,590
Hopefully the quiz didn't put
people into such panic modes

43
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,180
that they forgot
Monday's lecture.

44
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,130
So let's make sure that
we can do regular minimax

45
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,639
algorithm on this tree
and figure out the minimax

46
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,270
value at A.

47
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,900
So let's see how that works.

48
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,010
All right, as you guys
remember, the game search

49
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,320
when using regular
minimax is essentially

50
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,550
a depth first search.

51
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,080
And at each level, it
chooses between all

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,510
of the children whichever
value that the parent wants.

53
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,480
So here after it would choose
the maximum of K and L,

54
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,330
for instance.

55
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,570
But that's getting
ahead of ourselves.

56
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,986
Because it's a
depth first search.

57
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:40,874
So we best start at the top.

58
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:42,290
I'll help you guys
up for a while.

59
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,480
So we're doing A. We
need the maximum of B, C,

60
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,770
D, depth first search.

61
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,760
We go to B. We're looking
for the minimum of E and F.

62
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,980
So having looked at E, our
current minimum of E and F

63
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,780
is just 2 for the moment.

64
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:04,040
So this is going to be
less than or equal to 2.

65
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,690
All right, then we go down
to F, which is a maximizer.

66
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,850
And its children are
K and L. So now I'm

67
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,650
going to start making
you guys do stuff.

68
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,960
So what do you think?

69
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,620
What is going to be
the minimax value at F?

70
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,659
The minimax value at
F, what will that be?

71
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,534
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

72
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,150


73
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,090
PROFESSOR: So that level is
a maximizer-- max, min, max.

74
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,280
F is a maximizer.

75
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,420
K and L themselves
are minimizers.

76
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,200
But they're pretty
impotent minimizers.

77
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,590
Because they don't
get to choose.

78
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,950
They just have to do K or L.
So the minimax value is three.

79
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,660
And yeah, the path it
would like to go is K.

80
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,510
So we'll say that the
minimax value here is 3.

81
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,680
It's in fact exactly equal to 3.

82
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,410
So if this is 3 and this
is 2, then everyone,

83
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,476
we know that the value of B is?

84
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:57,710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

85
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,960
PROFESSOR: I hear 3 and 2.

86
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,281
Which one is it?

87
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:00,780
AUDIENCE: 2.

88
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,150
PROFESSOR: 2, that's right.

89
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,600
So the value here is 2.

90
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,790
Great, let's go down
into this branch.

91
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,427
So C is going to be
the minimum of G and 6.

92
00:04:09,427 --> 00:04:10,510
But we don't see that yet.

93
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,218
Because we're doing
a depth first search.

94
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,840
It's going to be
the minimum of G.

95
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,540
Now we need the
maximum of M and N.

96
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,160
We're going to need the minimum.

97
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,530
M is the minimum of Q and
R. So let's switch sides.

98
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,100
The minimum of Q and R is?

99
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,305
AUDIENCE: 1.

100
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:29,180
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

101
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,570
That's right, it's 1.

102
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,170
So M has a value of 1.

103
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,240
But I'm going to stay over here.

104
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,140
Because M has a value of 1.

105
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,100
Knowing that, then we know
that G has a value of?

106
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,600
AUDIENCE: 7

107
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
PROFESSOR: That's right.

108
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,930
7 is higher than 1.

109
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,550
And since G is a 7, we
now know going up to C

110
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,850
that C has a value of?

111
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,850
AUDIENCE: 6.

112
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,830
PROFESSOR: Yes, C
has a value of 6.

113
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,710
That's the minimum 6 and 7.

114
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,600
So now I'm going
to go back down.

115
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,370
Because we've done one
of the other sub-trees.

116
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,751
This is a 6.

117
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,950
All right, great.

118
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,900
Now we're going to go down to D.
Hopefully it won't be too bad.

119
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,760
These things usually
aren't terrible.

120
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,710
Because they're made to be
pruned a lot in alpha-beta.

121
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,350
So let's see, in D, we go down
to I. And that's just a 1.

122
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,040
We go down to J. And let's see,
what's the minimax value of J?

123
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,860
AUDIENCE: It's 20.

124
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,860
PROFESSOR: That's right.

125
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,120
20 is the maximum of 20 and 2.

126
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,780
Great, so what's the
minimax value of D?

127
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,990
Everyone said it-- 1.

128
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,946
All right, so what's
the minimax value at A?

129
00:05:27,946 --> 00:05:29,574
AUDIENCE: 6.

130
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:30,490
PROFESSOR: 6 is right.

131
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,660
6 is higher than 2.

132
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,740
It's higher than 1.

133
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,020
Our value is 6.

134
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:41,960
And our path is-- everyone--
A, C, H. That's it.

135
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,329
Great, is everyone
good with minimax?

136
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:47,995
I know that usually
a lot of people are.

137
00:05:47,995 --> 00:05:49,510
There's usually a few
people who aren't.

138
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,950
So if you're one
of the people who

139
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,150
would like some clarifications
on minimax, raise your hand.

140
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,680
There's probably a few other
people who would like some too.

141
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,536
OK.

142
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:03,350
AUDIENCE: When you're doing
this minimax, whatever values

143
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,752
are not showing, you
keep going down the tree

144
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:08,452
and then just look
at whether you're

145
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,670
trying to find the minimax.

146
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,380
And just whatever values
you get you go back up one?

147
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,710
PROFESSOR: Yes.

148
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:20,340
The question was, when you go
to do the minimax-- and let's

149
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,724
say you got E was
2, and you know

150
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:23,640
that B is going to be
less than or equal to 2,

151
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,160
but you don't know F yet.

152
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,350
The question is, do you go down
the tree, find the value at F,

153
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,460
and then go back up?

154
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,270
The answer is yes.

155
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,300
By default, we use a
depth first search.

156
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,550
However, in non alpha-beta
version, just regular minimax,

157
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,900
it turns out it probably
doesn't matter what you do.

158
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,150
I suggested doing a depth
first search to get yourself

159
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,630
in the mindset of alpha-beta.

160
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,290
Because order is very, very
important in alpha-beta.

161
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,150
But here, I don't know, you
could do some weird bottom

162
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,110
up search.

163
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,010
Whatever you want, it's going
to give you the right answer

164
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,380
unless it asks what
order they evaluated.

165
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,280
But here's a hint.

166
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,790
The order they're evaluated in
is depth first search order.

167
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:09,620
So without even doing anything,
E, K, L, Q, R, N, H, I, O, P

168
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,355
are the order of starting
evaluation in this tree.

169
00:07:13,355 --> 00:07:14,230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

170
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:20,330


171
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,950
PROFESSOR: So the question
is, nodes like M and G

172
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,130
we don't have to
put values next to.

173
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,420
Technically, if we were
doing this very formally,

174
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,560
and we couldn't
remember, and I wasn't

175
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,780
up there among the people,
we would put 1 there.

176
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,580
So at M, we would put a 1.

177
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,829
But people remembered that.

178
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:38,620
So we didn't do it.

179
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,599
But then at G, we would put a 7.

180
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,390
So if we were writing
it out very formally,

181
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,280
we would have a 1 and a 7.

182
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,920
And at this D, we
would have a 1.

183
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,650
And then at the A,
we would put a 6.

184
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,140
And then that's the answer.

185
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,510
Also, we've even put things
like less than or greater

186
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,070
than part way along the way.

187
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,590
However, I believe that
our alpha-beta search

188
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,960
is going to definitely
fulfill everyone's quota

189
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,030
of pedantically putting lots
of numbers next to nodes

190
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,650
on a game tree.

191
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,470
And so once you've
done alpha-beta,

192
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,870
if you can do it
correctly, you'll

193
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,260
think, oh, minimax, oh,
those were the days.

194
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,590
It's going to be easy.

195
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:22,170
Because alpha-beta is a
little bit more complicated.

196
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,490
There's a lot of things
that trip people up here.

197
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,270
For alpha-beta,
however, I will erase

198
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,750
some of these numbers
for the moment.

199
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,660
They're still right.

200
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,700
But we do it a
little differently.

201
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,470
So what do alpha-beta and
beta add to this formula?

202
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,710
Well, this is all sort
of a winning formula,

203
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,679
except for it's not.

204
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,490
Because it takes too long.

205
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,620
But it's a very nice formula.

206
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,600
U is the maximizer, say.

207
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,410
I would try to think, if I do
this, what's he going to do?

208
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,430
And then if he does that,
what am I going to do?

209
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,340
And then what is
he going to do if I

210
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,040
do that, et cetera, et cetera,
all the way to the bottom.

211
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,560
With alpha and
beta, we add in what

212
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,644
I like to call nuclear options.

213
00:09:02,644 --> 00:09:04,560
I'd like in this game
of maximizer minimizer--

214
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,389
you can think of it as like the
Cold War or the Peloponnesian

215
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:09,680
War, except the Peloponnesian
War didn't have nukes, so

216
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,710
probably the Cold War.

217
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,200
And in the Cold War,
or any situation

218
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,477
where you're up against an
adversary who-- actually,

219
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,560
this doesn't really work
as well for the Cold War.

220
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,935
But in any situation
where you're

221
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:24,920
up against an adversary
whose only goal in life

222
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,260
is to destroy you,
you always want

223
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,480
to find out what the best
thing you can possibly do

224
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,850
is if they hit that button
and send nukes in from Cuba,

225
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,270
or if they send fighter pilots,
or whatever is going on.

226
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,600
So the idea of alpha
and beta is that they

227
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:45,030
are numbers that represent
the fail-safe, the worst case.

228
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,590
Because obviously
in the Cold War,

229
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,820
sending nukes was
not a good plan.

230
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,230
But presumably, us
sending nukes would

231
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,880
be better than just being
attacked and killed.

232
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:04,150
So the alpha and beta represent
the worst possible outcome

233
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:07,470
you'd be willing to
accept for your side.

234
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,080
Because right now,
you know you're

235
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,400
guaranteed to be able to force
the conflict to that point

236
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,840
or better.

237
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,780
So the alpha is the nuclear
option, the fail-safe,

238
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,420
of the maximizer.

239
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,890
Nuclear options-- alpha is
maximizer's nuclear option.

240
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:34,980


241
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,430
And beta is the
minimizer's nuclear option.

242
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:46,994


243
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,410
So we ask ourselves-- and
people who were paying attention

244
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,240
at lecture or wrote stuff
down know the answer already--

245
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,240
what could we possibly
set to start off?

246
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,230
Before we explore the
tree and find anything,

247
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,760
what will we set as
our nuclear option,

248
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,280
as our sort of fail-safe?

249
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,490
We could always fall
back on this number.

250
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,630
So you could set 0.

251
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,580
You could try to set some
low number for the maximizer.

252
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,960
Because if you set a high
number for the maximizer

253
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,150
as its fail-safe, it's going to
be really snooty and just say,

254
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,310
oh, I won't take this path.

255
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,770
I already have a
fail-safe that's

256
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:19,970
better than all these paths.

257
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,460
If you set, like,
100, you have no tree.

258
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,990
Our default usually, in 6034,
is to set negative infinity

259
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,340
for alpha or negative some very
large number if you're doing it

260
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,770
in your lab.

261
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:37,670
So if we set negative infinity
as a default for alpha,

262
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,600
that negative infinity is
basically maximizer loses.

263
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,020
So the maximizer
goes in thinking,

264
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,894
oh my god, if I don't
look at this game tree,

265
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:46,260
I automatically lose.

266
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,070
He's willing to take the
first path possibly presented.

267
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,764
And that's why that
negative infinity

268
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:53,930
is a good default for alpha.

269
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,096
Anyone have a good idea
what a good default for beta

270
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:57,710
is, or just remember?

271
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,090
Positive infinity, that's right.

272
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,423
Because the minimizer comes
in, and she's like, oh crap,

273
00:12:01,423 --> 00:12:05,660
the maximizer automatically wins
if I don't look at this node

274
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,320
here.

275
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,278
That makes sure the
maximizer and the minimizer

276
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:12,240
both are willing to look at the
first path they see every time.

277
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,635
Because look on this tree.

278
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:16,560
If 10 was alpha, the
maximizer would just

279
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,020
reject out of hand
everything except for P.

280
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,440
And then we wouldn't
have a tree.

281
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,750
The maximizer would lose,
because he would be like, hmm,

282
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,790
this test game is
very interesting.

283
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,120
However, I have
another option-- pft,

284
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,380
and then you throw
over the table.

285
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,976
That's 10 for me, because you
have to pick up the pieces.

286
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:34,850
I don't own this set.

287
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,990
I don't know.

288
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,440
So that is why we set negative
infinity and positive infinity

289
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,770
as the default for
alpha and beta.

290
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,240
So how do alpha
and beta propagate?

291
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,870
And what do they do?

292
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,110
The main purpose of alpha
and beta is that, as we said,

293
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,130
alpha-- let's say we have
some chart of values.

294
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,700
Alpha, which starts
at negative infinity,

295
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,935
is the worst that the
maximizer is willing to accept.

296
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:01,060
Because they know they can
get that much or better.

297
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,800
It starts out, that's the
worst thing you can have.

298
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,470
So it's not a problem.

299
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,890
Infinity is the highest that the
minimizer is willing to accept.

300
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,430
That's beta.

301
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,250
As you go along,
though, the minimizer

302
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,970
sees, oh, look at that.

303
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,610
I can guarantee that at
best the maximizer gets 100.

304
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,700
Haha, beta is now 100.

305
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,790
The maximizer says, oh yeah?

306
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,490
Well I can guarantee that the
lowest you can get me to go to

307
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,280
is 0.

308
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,330
So it's going to be 0.

309
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:36,990
And this keeps going on
until maybe at 6-- note,

310
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,670
not drawn to scale.

311
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,940
Maybe at 6, the
maximizer said, haha,

312
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,030
you can't make me
go lower than 6.

313
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,650
And the minimizer says, aha, you
can't make me go higher than 6.

314
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,120
And then 6 is the answer.

315
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,950
If you ever get to a point where
beta gets lower than alpha,

316
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:02,000
or alpha gets lower than beta,
then you just say, screw this.

317
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,570
I'm not even going to look
at the remaining stuff.

318
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,870
I'm going to just prune now
and go somewhere else that's

319
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,780
less pointless than this.

320
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,220
Because if the alpha gets higher
than the beta, what that's

321
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,515
saying is the maximizer says,
oh man, look at this, minimizer.

322
00:14:18,515 --> 00:14:22,450
The lowest you can
make me go is, say, 50.

323
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,300
And the minimizer
says, that's strange.

324
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,760
Because the highest that
you can make me go is 40.

325
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,210
So something's
generally amiss there.

326
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,220
It usually means that
one of the two of them

327
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,890
doesn't even want to be
exploring that branch at all.

328
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,816
So you prune at that point.

329
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:43,470
All right, so given that
that's what we're looking for,

330
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,650
how do we move the alphas and
betas throughout the tree?

331
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,400
There's a few different
ways to draw them.

332
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,830
And some of them I
consider to be very busy.

333
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,930
Probably in recitation
and tutorial

334
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,980
you will see a way that's
busier and has more numbers.

335
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,060
Technically, every node has
both an alpha and a beta.

336
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,560
However, the one that that
node is paying attention to

337
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,190
is the alpha, if
it's a maximizer,

338
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,360
and the beta if
it's a minimizer.

339
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,290
So I generally, for my purposes,
only draw the alpha out

340
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,330
for the maximizer and only draw
the beta out for the minimizer.

341
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,742
Very rarely, but it happens,
they'll sometimes ask you,

342
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:21,450
well, what's the beta
of this node, which

343
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,460
is a maximizer node?

344
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,680
So it's good to know
how it's derived.

345
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,540
But I think that it wastes
your time to write it out.

346
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,520
That's my opinion.

347
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,820
We'll see how it goes.

348
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,720
So the way that it works, the
way that alpha and beta works,

349
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,970
is the Snow White principal.

350
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,100
So does everyone know
the story of Snow White?

351
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,860
So there's a beautiful princess.

352
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,696
There's an evil
queen stepmother.

353
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:43,070
Mirror mirror on the wall,
who's the fairest of them all,

354
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,620
finds out that it's
the stepdaughter.

355
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,130
So much like in the real
world, in Snow White,

356
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,440
the stepdaughter, Snow White,
had the beauty of her parents.

357
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,070
She inherited those.

358
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,560
However, much like in
the real world, maybe

359
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,810
or perhaps not, the stepmother
had an even better plan.

360
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,980
She hired a hunter to
sort of hunt Snow White,

361
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,560
pull out Snow White's
heart, and feed it

362
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,710
to her so that she
could gain Snow White's

363
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,590
beauty for herself.

364
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,900
How many people knew that
version of the story?

365
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,590
A few people.

366
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,298
That's the original
version of the story.

367
00:16:17,298 --> 00:16:18,570
Disney didn't put that in.

368
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,944
The hunter then
brought the heart

369
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:22,250
of a deer, which I think in
Disney the hunter did kill

370
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,130
a deer arbitrarily,
but it was not

371
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,260
explained that that's
why he was doing it.

372
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,540
So in alpha-beta,
it's just like that.

373
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,760
By which I mean you start
by inheriting the alpha

374
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,400
and beta of your parents.

375
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,360
But if you see something that
you like amongst your children,

376
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,810
you take it for yourself--
the Snow White principle.

377
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,100
So let's see how that goes.

378
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,200
Well, I told you guys that
the default alpha was--

379
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,612
AUDIENCE: Negative infinity.

380
00:16:49,612 --> 00:16:50,820
PROFESSOR: Negative infinity.

381
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,300
So here alpha is
negative infinity.

382
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,310
And I told you that the default
beta was positive infinity.

383
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,110
We're doing a depth
first search here.

384
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,590
All right, beta is infinity.

385
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:09,099
All right, so we come here to
E. Now, we could put an alpha.

386
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:12,140
But I never put
an alpha or a beta

387
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,250
for one of the terminal nodes.

388
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,329
Because it can't
really do anything.

389
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,060
It's just 2.

390
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,352
So as we go down, we
take the alpha and beta

391
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:23,060
from our parents.

392
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,830
But as we go up to a
parent, if the parent likes

393
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,450
what it sees in the child,
it takes it instead.

394
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,440
So I ask you all the
question, would the minimizer

395
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,490
prefer this 2 that it sees from
its child or its own infinity

396
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,630
for a beta?

397
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,390
AUDIENCE: 2

398
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,790
PROFESSOR: It likes the 2.

399
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,190
That's absolutely right.

400
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,060
So 2.

401
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,575
All right, great, so now we go
down to F. What is F's alpha?

402
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:51,854


403
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:55,938
Who says negative infinity?

404
00:17:55,938 --> 00:17:58,220
Who says 2?

405
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,690
No one-- oh, you guys are good.

406
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,220
It's negative infinity.

407
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,094
Technically, it also
will have a beta of 2.

408
00:18:06,094 --> 00:18:07,260
But we're ignoring the beta.

409
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,890
And the alphas that have
been progressing downward

410
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,962
from the parents--
negative infinity.

411
00:18:11,962 --> 00:18:14,170
That's why I called it the
grandfather clause before.

412
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:19,280
Because you would often look up
to your grandparent to see what

413
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,800
your default number is.

414
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,830
So we get an alpha
of negative infinity.

415
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,134
We then go down to the K.
It's a static evaluation.

416
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:28,550
And now I'm going to start
calling on people individually.

417
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,450
So hopefully people
paid attention

418
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,010
to the mob, who
were always correct.

419
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,520
All right, so we go down
to K. And we see a 3.

420
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
F is a maximizer node.

421
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,300
So what does F do now?

422
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,450
AUDIENCE: Switches
its alpha to 3.

423
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,350
PROFESSOR: Yes, switches
its alpha to 3, great.

424
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:55,430


425
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:59,005
All right, so that's
already quite good.

426
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,075
It switches alpha to 3.

427
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:01,330
It's very happy.

428
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,526
It's got a 3 here.

429
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:06,360
That's a nice value.

430
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:16,736
So what does it do
at L, the next node?

431
00:19:16,736 --> 00:19:18,865
It's gone to K, went
back up to F. Depth

432
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:20,740
first search, the next
one would be L, right?

433
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,274


434
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:24,149
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

435
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:27,376


436
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:32,420
PROFESSOR: Well, technically
F could take L's value of 0

437
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,690
if it liked it better than 3.

438
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,590
But it's a maximizer.

439
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,535
So does it want to take that?

440
00:19:37,535 --> 00:19:38,410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

441
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,310
PROFESSOR: OK, that
technically would be correct.

442
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,893
But I'm sorry.

443
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:43,830
I burdened you with
a trick question.

444
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,180
In fact, we don't
look at L at all.

445
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,780


446
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,510
Does everyone see that?

447
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,740
I'll explain.

448
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,190
The alpha at F has reached 3.

449
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,700
But the beta at B is 2.

450
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,600
So B looks down and
says, wait a minute.

451
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,990
If I go down to F, my
enemy's nuclear option,

452
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,450
my enemy is the worst it
can be for-- the best it

453
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,960
can be for me is 3.

454
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,320
F is trumpeting it around.

455
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,436
I was thinking of eating
his heart, or whatever,

456
00:20:16,436 --> 00:20:17,310
but I didn't want to.

457
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,050
But it's going to be 3.

458
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:24,146
It's going to be 3 or
higher down there at F.

459
00:20:24,146 --> 00:20:25,270
There's no way I want that.

460
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:29,310
I already have my own
default escape plan.

461
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,219
And that's 2.

462
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:32,260
That's going to be better
than whatever comes out

463
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,871
of that horrible F. So screw it.

464
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:39,535
And we never look at L.
Does everyone get that?

465
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:43,520
That is the main principle
of alpha-beta pruning.

466
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,100
If you see an alpha that's
higher than the beta above it--

467
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,020
as I said, if alpha
goes up above the beta--

468
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,360
or if you see a beta, like
if there's a beta down here,

469
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,450
and it's lower than the
alpha above it, prune it.

470
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,450
Stop doing that.

471
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,270
And the question is, who prunes?

472
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,840
Who decides that
you don't look at L?

473
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,560
The person who is
thinking not to look at L

474
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,460
is always up higher by
at least two levels.

475
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,670
So up here, B is
saying, hmm, I don't

476
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,130
want to look at L. Because F
is already so terrible for me

477
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,890
that it's just beyond belief.

478
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,920
If this is 100, it might be 100.

479
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,350
Even if it's lower, I'm
still going to get a three.

480
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:33,330
There's a sanity check that
I've written that I sort of came

481
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,180
up with just in case you're
not sure that you can skip it.

482
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,060
Because on a lot of
these tests, we ask you,

483
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,884
which one's do you evaluate,
which ones do you skip, right?

484
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:42,675
Or we just say, which
ones do you evaluate,

485
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:44,760
and you don't write
the ones that you skip.

486
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,860
Here's my sanity test to
see if you can skip it.

487
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,080
Ask yourself, if
that node that I'm

488
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,040
about to skip contained
a negative infinity

489
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,550
or some arbitrarily small
number, negative infinity

490
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:01,260
being the minimizer wins,
would it change anything?

491
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,920
Now that I've
answered that, if it

492
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,350
contained a positive infinity,
would it change anything?

493
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:11,820
If the answer is no
both times, then you're

494
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,760
definitely correct
in pruning it.

495
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,850
So look at that 0.

496
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,810
If it was a negative
infinity, minimizer wins,

497
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,705
what would happen?

498
00:22:17,705 --> 00:22:20,320
The maximizer would say, I'm
not touching that was a 10 foot

499
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,370
pole, choosing 3.

500
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,380
The minimizer would say,
screw that, I'll take E.

501
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,005
Let's say it was a
positive infinity.

502
00:22:28,005 --> 00:22:31,075
The maximizer would say,
eureka, holy grain, I win.

503
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:33,080
The minimizer would say,
yeah, if I'm a moron,

504
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,450
and go down to F, and then
would go to E and take 2.

505
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:41,640
So no matter what was there,
the minimizer would go to E.

506
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,100
And you could say, well,
what if it was exactly 2?

507
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,130
But still the
maximizer would choose

508
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,520
K. The minimizer would
go to E. So there's

509
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,680
no reason to go down there.

510
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,410
We can just prune
it off right now.

511
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,070
Does everyone
agree, everyone see

512
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,720
what I'm talking about here?

513
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,225
Great, so we're now
done with this branch.

514
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:01,790
Because beta is 2.

515
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,232
So now we're up at
old grandpappy A.

516
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:06,940
And he has an alpha
of negative infinity.

517
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,660
Everyone, what will he do?

518
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,709
He'll take the 2.

519
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:14,500
It's better than negative
infinity for him.

520
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,600
It's not wonderful.

521
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,670
But certainly anything is
better than an automatic loss.

522
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:23,780
All right, now our
highest node is a 2.

523
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,380
So let's keep that in
mind for our alpha.

524
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,820
OK, so let's go over here.

525
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,854
Let's see, so what
will be the value at C?

526
00:23:32,854 --> 00:23:34,020
What will be the beta value?

527
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,366


528
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:40,282
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

529
00:23:40,282 --> 00:23:42,712


530
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,660
PROFESSOR: You go
back to which one?

531
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,090
To G. I'm not at G yet.

532
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,800
I'm actually just starting
the middle branch.

533
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,280
So I'm going to C. And what's
going to be its starting

534
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,902
beta before I go down?

535
00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:56,170
AUDIENCE: Infinity.

536
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,910
PROFESSOR: Infinity, that's
right-- default value.

537
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,570
It's easier than it seemed.

538
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,690
All right, so yes, beta
is equal to infinity.

539
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,370


540
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,090
This should be better erased.

541
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,570
I think it's confusing people.

542
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:14,790
Great, OK, so beta is
equal to infinity at C.

543
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,110
Now we go down depth
first search to G. What's

544
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,460
going to be our alpha at G?

545
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,620
AUDIENCE: Minus infinity.

546
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,560
PROFESSOR: Ahh,
it would seem so.

547
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:26,110
However, take a look up
at the great-grandpappy A.

548
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,490
It seems to have changed to 2.

549
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,930
So this time it's 2.

550
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,680
Why is it 2 instead
of negative infinity?

551
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,873
Why can we let A be so noxious
and not start with saying,

552
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,710
oh, I automatically lose?

553
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,040
Well, A knows that no
matter how awful things get

554
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,680
in that middle branch,
he can just say,

555
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,930
screw the whole middle branch.

556
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,110
I'm going to B.

557
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,796
That's something that
the minimizer can't do.

558
00:24:47,796 --> 00:24:49,920
And we have to start at
infinity for the minimizer.

559
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,140
But the maximizer can.

560
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,790
Because he has the
choice at the top.

561
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,850
Does everyone see that?

562
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,440
He can just say, oh, I'm
not even going to C. Yeah,

563
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,330
shows you.

564
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,320
I'm going to A and taking the 2.

565
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,640
So therefore alpha
is actually 2 at G.

566
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,500
All right, great, so
we've got an alpha that's

567
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,790
2 at G. We're going to go
down to M. It's a minimizer.

568
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:14,407
All right, what's going
to be our beta value at M?

569
00:25:14,407 --> 00:25:15,282
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

570
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:19,230


571
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,325
PROFESSOR: Or which is
the beta default, minus

572
00:25:21,325 --> 00:25:22,200
or positive infinity?

573
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,554
What would be the minimizer?

574
00:25:24,554 --> 00:25:25,345
AUDIENCE: Positive.

575
00:25:25,345 --> 00:25:27,180
PROFESSOR: Positive
infinity, that's right.

576
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,250
M is going to be a
positive infinity for beta.

577
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:34,670
Again, it picks it
up from C. Great,

578
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,030
now we get to some
actual values.

579
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,390
So we're at some actual values.

580
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:45,520
We are at Q. So
what's going to happen

581
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,230
at M when M sees that Q is 1?

582
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:53,431


583
00:25:53,431 --> 00:25:55,040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

584
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
PROFESSOR: What is beta?

585
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,371
It says infinity.

586
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:57,890
I'm sorry, it's hard to read.

587
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,486
Beta is infinity at M.

588
00:25:59,486 --> 00:26:01,470
AUDIENCE: OK, so it's
going to minimize, right?

589
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:05,001
So it's going to be
like, OK, [INAUDIBLE].

590
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:06,000
PROFESSOR: That's right.

591
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,270
So they're going
to put beta to 1.

592
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:16,250
Because it sees Q. Great,
so my next question is,

593
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,124
what's going to happen at R?

594
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:22,052
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

595
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:28,030


596
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,010
PROFESSOR: Very smart.

597
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,397
You've detected my trap.

598
00:26:31,397 --> 00:26:32,855
The question is,
does it look at R?

599
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:35,142
The answer is, no.

600
00:26:35,142 --> 00:26:37,100
It doesn't look at R.
Why doesn't it look at R?

601
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,020
Does everyone see?

602
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,330
Yeah, alpha is now greater
than the beta below it.

603
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,917
Beta has gotten
lower than alpha.

604
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:46,000
This is the same thing I
was talking about before,

605
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,090
when we figured out that
the alpha here is 2.

606
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:52,470
The maximizer says,
wait a minute.

607
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,740
The maximizer G says, if I go
to M, the best I'm getting out

608
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,759
of this is 1.

609
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:58,300
Because if this is
negative infinity,

610
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,680
the minimizer will choose it.

611
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,555
If this is positive
infinity, he'll choose 1.

612
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:04,237
The best I'm going to
get out of here is 1.

613
00:27:04,237 --> 00:27:06,320
If that's the case, I might
as well have just gone

614
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,600
to B and not even gone to C.
So I'm not going to go to M.

615
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,440
I'll go to N, maybe.

616
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,370
Maybe N is better.

617
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,300
Does everyone see that?

618
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,270
Great, so let's say that
the maximizer does go to N.

619
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:23,379
So what's going to
happen with this alpha?

620
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:24,800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

621
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,640
PROFESSOR: That's right,
it's going to be 7.

622
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,080
7 is better than 2.

623
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,960
And the maximizer has
control to get to that seven,

624
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,940
at least if it gets to G. All
right, now the minimizer at C--

625
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,580
we'll do everyone this time.

626
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,798
The minimizer at C, seeing that
7, what does the minimizer do?

627
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:44,298
Anyone?

628
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:48,200


629
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,210
So it sees the 7.

630
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,680
What does it do to its beta?

631
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,330
It takes the 7-- better
than infinity, anyway.

632
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,290
And yeah, then it checks H.
And everybody, again, what

633
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,100
happens at H?

634
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,970
It takes the 6.

635
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,865
It's lower than 7.

636
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:04,730


637
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,747
All right, now we'll
go back to having

638
00:28:07,747 --> 00:28:08,830
people do it on their own.

639
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,246
Well, all the way
back to the top,

640
00:28:10,246 --> 00:28:13,216
what does A do when it
sees the 6 coming out of C?

641
00:28:13,216 --> 00:28:15,150
AUDIENCE: Changes to 6.

642
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,330
PROFESSOR: Changes
to 6, that's right.

643
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,910
Alpha equals 6.

644
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:24,620
Great-- homestretch,
people, homestretch.

645
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:31,650
So the minimizer, everyone,
has a beta of infinity.

646
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:35,070
And if I wasn't a static node,
it would have an alpha of 6.

647
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,090
But it is a static node.

648
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,570
So it just has a value of 1.

649
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:43,380
So since it has a value of 1,
everyone, the beta becomes 1.

650
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,264
And what next, everyone?

651
00:28:45,264 --> 00:28:45,930
AUDIENCE: Prune.

652
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,960
PROFESSOR: Prune, that's right.

653
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,110
Why prune?

654
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,650
Well, this time it's A
himself who can prune.

655
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,723
A says, well darn,
if I go to D, I'm

656
00:28:56,723 --> 00:28:59,360
going to get 1 or something
even worse than 1.

657
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,550
I might as well take
my 6 while I have it,

658
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,875
prune all the rest
all the way down.

659
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:09,210


660
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,620
Everyone see that?

661
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,710
Everyone cool with that?

662
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:16,060
It's not too bad if you
take it one step at a time.

663
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,410
We did it.

664
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:21,966
Our question is, which nodes
are evaluated in order?

665
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:35,170
Our answer is, everyone-- E, K,
Q, N, H, I. OK, not so obvious,

666
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:35,670
I guess.

667
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,980
A few people followed me.

668
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,590
But it is E, K, Q, N, H, I.
It's just depth first order.

669
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,220
And we pruned some of them away.

670
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,260
Great, so that is alpha-beta.

671
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,470
Any questions about that
before I give some questions

672
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,022
about progressive deepening?

673
00:29:52,022 --> 00:29:53,230
All right, we've got a bunch.

674
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,182
So first question.

675
00:29:55,182 --> 00:30:02,480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
nodes like F, B, C, and D?

676
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,190
PROFESSOR: The
question is, when asked

677
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,900
for the order of evaluation,
are we excluding F, B, C, and D?

678
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,250
The answer is we're talking
about here static evaluation.

679
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,720
The static evaluator is a
very important and interesting

680
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,400
function.

681
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,230
And I'll get back to something
a few students have asked me

682
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,484
about the static evaluator later
and try to explain what it is.

683
00:30:21,484 --> 00:30:23,650
It's basically the thing
that pops out those numbers

684
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,015
at the bottom of the leaves.

685
00:30:25,015 --> 00:30:26,765
So when we ask, what
is the order of nodes

686
00:30:26,765 --> 00:30:31,510
that were statically
evaluated, we mean leaves only.

687
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,580
That's a good question.

688
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,620
Any other questions?

689
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,430
Let's see, there was
one up here before.

690
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,170
But it's gone.

691
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,885
It might have been the same one.

692
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:38,384
Question?

693
00:30:38,384 --> 00:30:39,717
AUDIENCE: So a similar question.

694
00:30:39,717 --> 00:30:42,578
When you say, static nodes,
that just means the leaf nodes?

695
00:30:42,578 --> 00:30:43,750
PROFESSOR: Means the
leaf nodes, that's right.

696
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,041
The question is, does static
nodes mean the leaf nodes.

697
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:46,903
The answer is yes.

698
00:30:46,903 --> 00:30:48,319
AUDIENCE: And so
static evaluation

699
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,737
is when you compare the value
of a static node to something?

700
00:30:51,737 --> 00:30:53,570
PROFESSOR: Static
evaluation is when you get

701
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,180
that number, the static node.

702
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,480
Let me explain.

703
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,140
Unless someone else has another
question about alpha-beta,

704
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,500
let me explain static values.

705
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,030
Because I was about to do that.

706
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,571
There is a question
about alpha-beta.

707
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:06,326
I'll come back to both of
yours after I answer this.

708
00:31:06,326 --> 00:31:09,437
AUDIENCE: You were
mentioning [INAUDIBLE].

709
00:31:09,437 --> 00:31:11,385
And I'm a little bit confused.

710
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:13,576
If you're looking at
one node, and you're

711
00:31:13,576 --> 00:31:16,255
seeing either grab the
value from the grandparent

712
00:31:16,255 --> 00:31:18,203
or grab it from the--

713
00:31:18,203 --> 00:31:21,134
PROFESSOR: So it always
starts-- the question is, what

714
00:31:21,134 --> 00:31:22,300
is the Snow White principle?

715
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,380
How does it work?

716
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,760
Every node always
starts off with taking

717
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,865
the value of the same
type, alpha or beta,

718
00:31:29,865 --> 00:31:30,740
from its grandparent.

719
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,010
It always starts that way.

720
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,427
Now, you say, why
the grandparent?

721
00:31:34,427 --> 00:31:35,926
Wouldn't it take
it from the parent?

722
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:37,050
It actually does.

723
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,430
But I'm not drawing out the
alphas at all the minimizer

724
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:39,700
levels.

725
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,991
Because they don't do anything.

726
00:31:40,991 --> 00:31:44,200
They're only even there
to pass them down.

727
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,110
So all of the values pass
down, down, down, down, down

728
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,050
to begin.

729
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:55,390
Every node, in fact, starts
off with its grandparents

730
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,920
with its parents' values, OK?

731
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,730
But then when the
node sees a child,

732
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,780
it's completely done evaluating.

733
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,360
It's finished.

734
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,380
It can't be in the process.

735
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:13,550
Let's say C. When C sees
that G is completely

736
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,780
done with all of
its sub-branches

737
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,760
and is ready to return
a value, or if it's just

738
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,120
a static evaluation, then it's
automatically completely done.

739
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,020
Because it has no children.

740
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,550
A static value like K of 3 is
automatically completely done.

741
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,830
It's got a 3.

742
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,360
Similarly, when we came
back to G after going to N,

743
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,140
and we knew that the value was
7, that was completely done.

744
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,730
The value was definitely 7.

745
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,480
There was no other
possibilities.

746
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,830
AUDIENCE: That's after looking
at the children, right?

747
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,500
PROFESSOR: Yes.

748
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,630
So once you're done with
all the children of G,

749
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,250
then G comes up and
says, guess what?

750
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,409
Guess what, guys?

751
00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:48,950
So technically before
that, you would

752
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:53,210
have said that G's alpha is
greater than or equal to 1

753
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,950
when we looked at Q. And then
we looked at M. We'd say,

754
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,640
it's equal exactly to 7.

755
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,890
We're done here.

756
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,170
And then at that point,
when it's fresh and ripe

757
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,890
and has all of its highest
value or its best value,

758
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,100
that's when the parent can eat
its heart and gain that value

759
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,980
itself.

760
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,340
So that's when C says,
for instance, oh man,

761
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,550
I have an infinity.

762
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,060
I really like that 7 better.

763
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,390
And it takes the 7.

764
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,840
But then it saw H. And it
said, oh man, that's a 6.

765
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,980
That's even better than 7.

766
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,765
So it took the 6.

767
00:33:21,765 --> 00:33:24,510
AUDIENCE: So shouldn't
the alpha take 7 then?

768
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,780
PROFESSOR: So alpha takes 6.

769
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,300
Because C is a minimizer.

770
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,960
C took the 7 from
G, but then right

771
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,810
after that C saw
H and took the 6.

772
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,880
Because 6 is even lower than 7.

773
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,160
And then alpha took the 6.

774
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,260
Because 6 was higher than 2.

775
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,824
AUDIENCE: So it's not going
to look below the branch?

776
00:33:42,824 --> 00:33:45,240
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the problem
is that the maximizer doesn't

777
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,490
have control there.

778
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,464
The minimizer has
got control at C.

779
00:33:48,464 --> 00:33:49,880
And the minimizer
is going to make

780
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,020
sure it's as low as possible.

781
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:56,470
The maximizer at A, his only
control, or her only control,

782
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,460
is the ability to send
either way to B or C

783
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,346
or D. And then at
that point, at C,

784
00:34:02,346 --> 00:34:04,345
the minimizer gets to
choose if we go to G or H.

785
00:34:04,345 --> 00:34:07,300
And it's never going to choose
G. Because G is higher than H.

786
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,829
All right, awesome, was
there another question?

787
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:12,830
All right, let's go back
to static evaluations.

788
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,139
When I first took this class,
I had some weird thoughts

789
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,139
about static evolutions.

790
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,739
I heard some
students ask me this.

791
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:21,475
I almost got a question about
it onto one of the tests,

792
00:34:21,475 --> 00:34:23,600
but it was edited to some
other weird question that

793
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,451
was m to the b to the
d minus 1 or something

794
00:34:25,451 --> 00:34:26,659
like that at the last minute.

795
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:28,909
So I'm going to pose you
guys the actual question that

796
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:31,520
would have been on one
of the older test, which

797
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,790
is the following.

798
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,873
I had a student who came
to me and said, you know,

799
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:37,489
[INAUDIBLE], when we do this
alpha-beta pruning, and all

800
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:40,560
this other stuff, we're trying
to assume that we're really

801
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,870
saving that much
time by getting rid

802
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,361
of a few static evaluations.

803
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:46,110
In fact, when we do
progressive deepening,

804
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,401
we're always just counting,
how many static evaluations

805
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:49,290
do we have to do?

806
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,586
And he said, I look at
these static evaluations.

807
00:34:51,586 --> 00:34:52,710
And there's just a 3 there.

808
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,520
It takes no time to do
the static evaluation.

809
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,890
It's on the board.

810
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,920
It takes much longer
to do the alpha-beta.

811
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,770
It's faster by far
to not do alpha-beta.

812
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,680
So I then tried to
explain to that student.

813
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,050
I said, OK, we need
to be clear about what

814
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,340
static evaluations are.

815
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,590
You guys get it easy.

816
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,657
We put these numbers
on the board.

817
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:13,240
A static evaluation--
let's say you're

818
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,010
playing a game like chess.

819
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,050
Static evaluation
takes a long time.

820
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,910
When I was in 6170,
Java [INAUDIBLE],

821
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,150
the class that used to
exist, we had a program

822
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:28,440
called Anti-Chess where I used
my 6034 skills to write the AI.

823
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,890
And the static evaluator
took a long time.

824
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:32,970
And we were timed.

825
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,970
So getting the static
evaluator faster,

826
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,602
that was the most
important thing.

827
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:37,810
Why does it take a long time?

828
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,875
Well, the static
evaluator is an evaluation

829
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:43,730
of the board position,
the state of the game,

830
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,519
at a snapshot of time.

831
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,060
And that's not as easy as just
saying, oh, here's the answer.

832
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,500
Because in chess,
first of all, not only

833
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,780
did I have to look at
how many pieces I had,

834
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,520
what areas that I controlled.

835
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,154
Also-- well, it was anti-chess.

836
00:35:58,154 --> 00:35:59,320
But that's not withstanding.

837
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,110
Let's pretend it's
regular chess.

838
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,900
I also had to look, if
it was in regular chess--

839
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,650
and I still had to do
this in anti-chess--

840
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,850
if my king was in check.

841
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,350
And what that meant
is I had to look

842
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,040
at all of my opponent's
moves, possible moves,

843
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,120
to see if anyone of
them could take my king.

844
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,921
Because in regular chess,
it's illegal to put your king

845
00:36:15,921 --> 00:36:16,420
into check.

846
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,830
So you better not
even allow that move.

847
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,500
And regardless,
getting into checkmate

848
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,670
is negative infinity for you.

849
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:27,100
So it takes a really long
time to do static evaluations,

850
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,380
at least good ones, usually.

851
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,400
You want to avoid them.

852
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,740
Because they're not just
some number on the page.

853
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,910
They are some function
you wrote that does

854
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:38,230
a very careful analysis of the
state of the game and says,

855
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:41,770
I'm good to heuristically
guess that my value is

856
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,580
pi, or some other
number, and then rates

857
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,060
that compared to other states.

858
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,530
Does that make
sense to everyone?

859
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,790
So the answer to the
hypothetical question

860
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,628
that might have been
on the old test, when

861
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,086
the person said, I've got this
great idea where you do tons

862
00:36:56,086 --> 00:36:57,544
of static evaluation,
and you don't

863
00:36:57,544 --> 00:37:00,620
have to do this long
alpha-beta, is, don't do that.

864
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:04,805
The static evaluations
actually take a long time.

865
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,680
Does that clear it up
for people who asked me

866
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,130
before about what is a static
evaluation, why are the leaf

867
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,030
nodes called static?

868
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,730


869
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,550
And you might ask, why are
some of these static just

870
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,140
arbitrarily?

871
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:23,030
The answer is, when you're
running out of time to expand

872
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:26,270
deeper, and you just need to
stop that stage of the game--

873
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,744
maybe it's just
getting too hairy,

874
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:29,160
maybe it's spreading
out too much,

875
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,760
you have some
heuristic that says,

876
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,500
this is where I
stop for now-- it's

877
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,740
a heuristic guess of the value.

878
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,990
It's kind of like those
heuristic values in the search

879
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:38,330
tree.

880
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,704
It's a guess of
how much work you

881
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:41,340
have left to get to the goal.

882
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,720
Here, you say, well, I
wish I could go deeper.

883
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,100
But I just don't have the time.

884
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,250
So here's how I think
I'm doing at this level.

885
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,359
It's not always right.

886
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,150
And that's going to
lead us into the answer

887
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,210
to one of the questions
about progressive deepening.

888
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,876
So I'll put up the
progressive deepening

889
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:56,050
question really quickly.

890
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:00,610
So the question is this.

891
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,610
Let me see, this is
a maximizer-- yes.

892
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:10,515
Suppose that we do progressive
deepening on the tree that

893
00:38:10,515 --> 00:38:11,600
is only two levels deep.

894
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,620
What is progressive deepening
in a nutshell if you don't

895
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,930
remember from the lecture?

896
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:17,890
The idea is this.

897
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,080
In this tree, it doesn't work.

898
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,550
But in trees that actually
branch like 2 to the n,

899
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,280
it doesn't take that much time
to do some of the top levels

900
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,240
first and then move on
to the bottom levels.

901
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,250
Just do them one at a time.

902
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,840
So let's say we only did it
up through J. We only did

903
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,890
the top two levels of the tree.

904
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,690
We'd like to reorder the
tree so that alpha-beta

905
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:43,250
can prune as much as it
possibly can, at least we hope.

906
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:47,240
So let's pretend that we
had a psychic awesome genius

907
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,520
friend who told us that the
static values when we went up

908
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,680
to two levels-- remember,
when we go to two levels,

909
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,440
F, G, and J have to get
a static value, right?

910
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,750
Because we're not going down.

911
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,180
We do a static evaluation.

912
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,410
They get the exact correct
numbers-- 3, 7, and 20.

913
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,573
Genius, brilliant.

914
00:39:03,573 --> 00:39:07,500
All right, so if
that happens, what

915
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,200
is the best way that we
could reorder that tree?

916
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:18,880
Oh yeah, so it's A, B, C, D with
values of 2, 3, 7, 6, 1, 20.

917
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,880
I'll draw that.

918
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,390
This is the non-reordered tree.

919
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:29,890


920
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:41,410
Let's see, so it's
2, 3, 7, 6, 1, 20.

921
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,584
So what's the best
way to reorder?

922
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:45,250
Well, first of all,
does anyone remember

923
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:49,300
what Patrick said when he talked
about progressive deepening?

924
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,800
Usually no one does, so
don't worry about it.

925
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,880
Because at that time
you guys didn't think,

926
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,390
oh, I have to do
this for the quiz.

927
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,987
You were just
thinking, oh man, we've

928
00:39:58,987 --> 00:40:01,070
already heard alpha-beta
and all this other stuff.

929
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,570
And this is just a small fact.

930
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,650
But it's a very important fact.

931
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,720
And now you know you have
to do it for the quiz.

932
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,600
So you're probably
going to remember it.

933
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,510
The way you do it is you
try to guess, and you say,

934
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,030
which one of these is
going to be a winner?

935
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,530
Whichever one I think is going
to be a winner at that level,

936
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,360
I put first.

937
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,500
Why is that the case?

938
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,110
Well, something interesting
you may have noticed here--

939
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:30,590
whenever you have a winner,
like the middle node,

940
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:34,060
or whenever you have
whatever is the current best

941
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,790
for your alpha, you sort
of have to explore out

942
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,160
a lot of that area.

943
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,390
Like for instance, the left
node was our current best at 2.

944
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,250
The middle branch
was our current best,

945
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,130
at that time was 6.

946
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,382
It was the total best.

947
00:40:46,382 --> 00:40:48,090
We had to explore a
good number of nodes.

948
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,370
But on the right, we
just saw, oh, there's 1.

949
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:50,930
We're done.

950
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:53,070
We cut everything off.

951
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,150
In other words, the
branch that turns out

952
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,052
to be the one that
you take, you have

953
00:40:57,052 --> 00:40:58,760
to do a pretty good
amount of exploration

954
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,554
to prove that it's
the right one.

955
00:41:00,554 --> 00:41:01,970
Whereas if it's
the wrong one, you

956
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:05,320
can sometimes with just one
node say, this is wrong, done.

957
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,100
So therefore, if the
one that turns out

958
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,510
to be the eventual
winner is first of all,

959
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,290
then it's really easy to
reject all the other branches.

960
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:16,490
Do people see that sort of
conceptually a little bit,

961
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:19,250
that if you get the
best node right away,

962
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:22,390
you can just reject all the
wrong ones pretty quickly?

963
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,560
That's our goal.

964
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,970
So how can we, quote, "get
the right one," the best one

965
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,040
right away?

966
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,050
Well, here's how we do it.

967
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,590
Let's say we're at B. Which one
is the minimizer likely to pick

968
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,800
assuming that our
heuristic is good

969
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,920
and that these guesses are
pretty much close to the truth?

970
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,261
It turns out they're perfect,
so this is going to work.

971
00:41:41,261 --> 00:41:42,760
So which one will
the minimizer pick

972
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,801
if it has to choose between
E and F, do we think?

973
00:41:44,801 --> 00:41:45,534
AUDIENCE: E.

974
00:41:45,534 --> 00:41:46,450
PROFESSOR: E, perfect.

975
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,981
Which one will it
pick between G and H?

976
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:49,481
AUDIENCE: H.

977
00:41:49,481 --> 00:41:51,689
PROFESSOR: H. Which one will
it pick between I and J?

978
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:52,470
AUDIENCE: I.

979
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,660
PROFESSOR: OK, so
what we're saying

980
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,790
is we think it's
going to pick E.

981
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:59,576
We think it's going to pick H.
We think it's going to pick I.

982
00:41:59,576 --> 00:42:02,830
So first of all, we should
put E before F, H before G,

983
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:06,490
and I before J. Because we think
it's going to pick those first.

984
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:10,190
Those are probably our best ones
to invalidate a poor branch.

985
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,360
So now between 2,
6, and 1, which

986
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,110
is what we think we're going
to get, which one do we think

987
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,691
the maximizer is going to take?

988
00:42:16,691 --> 00:42:17,190
AUDIENCE: 6.

989
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,050
PROFESSOR: 6.

990
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,940
Then if it couldn't take 6, what
would be its next best choice?

991
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,690
2, then 1.

992
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:27,120
That's just our
order-- simple as that.

993
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,630
It couldn't be
anything easier that

994
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,130
evolves really complex trees,
a huge number of numbers,

995
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:33,200
and reordering those trees.

996
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:42,905
So C-- you guys told me C, B,
D. You told me C, B, D, I think?

997
00:42:42,905 --> 00:42:44,780
Yeah, those are the ones
the maximizer likes.

998
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:49,740
And then the ones the minimizer
likes you told me was H,

999
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:53,150
and before G. Because
H is smaller than G.

1000
00:42:53,150 --> 00:43:03,710
You guys told me E before F.
And you guys told me I before J.

1001
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:07,120
And you guys would be
correct in all regards.

1002
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:12,490
We have 6, 7, 2, 3, 1, 20.

1003
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,450
All the minimizers choose
from smallest to highest.

1004
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:19,840
The maximizer chooses from
highest to lowest of the ones

1005
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,690
that the minimizers will take.

1006
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,320
And if we did that, you
can see we would probably

1007
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,160
save some time.

1008
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,640
Let's see how much time.

1009
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,770
Let's say we looked at H first.

1010
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,010
Well, if we looked
at H first, we

1011
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:39,060
would still have actually had
to look at Q and N. However,

1012
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:43,340
we would not have had to
look at K. Do people see why?

1013
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,970
If we already knew
this branch was 6,

1014
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:48,160
as soon as we saw 2 for the
beta here-- 2 is less than 6--

1015
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,752
we could have pruned.

1016
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,710
We still would have had
to look at I over here.

1017
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,480
Because you have to
look at at least one

1018
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,760
thing in the new sub-branch.

1019
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,500
And it actually only would
have saved us one node-- oops.

1020
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,740
So it winds up that in
total, how many nodes would

1021
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:10,350
we have evaluated if we did that
little scheme of reordering?

1022
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:17,050
Well, we normally had to
do six-- E, K, Q, N, H, I.

1023
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:20,391
How many do we evaluate if we
do this progressive deepening

1024
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:20,890
scheme?

1025
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:22,845
How many times do we run
the static evaluator,

1026
00:44:22,845 --> 00:44:24,970
which of course you know
the static evaluator takes

1027
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:26,620
a long time?

1028
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,400
Anyone have a guess?

1029
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:36,170
I told you the only one we don't
evaluate is K. Raise your hand.

1030
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:40,460
I won't make anyone
give this one.

1031
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,410
So I said the only
one we save on is K.

1032
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:49,180
So we still do E, Q,
N, H, and I over here.

1033
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,180
There's two possible
answers that I will accept.

1034
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,171
So you have a higher
chance of guessing it.

1035
00:44:53,171 --> 00:44:53,670
Anyway?

1036
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,200


1037
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,405
Does everyone agree
that we did six before?

1038
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,210
If we didn't do any
progressive deepening,

1039
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:08,932
we just did E, K, Q, N, H, I.
And now we're not doing K. OK,

1040
00:45:08,932 --> 00:45:09,890
people are saying five.

1041
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:11,074
All right, good.

1042
00:45:11,074 --> 00:45:12,240
That's not the right answer.

1043
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,680
But it at least shows that you
can do taking away the one.

1044
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,489
We did at least five over here.

1045
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:19,030
There's two possible
answers, though.

1046
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,412
Because look over there.

1047
00:45:20,412 --> 00:45:22,120
In order to do the
progressive deepening,

1048
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:27,850
we had to do those static
evaluations, right?

1049
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:34,190
So we either did all
those static evaluations

1050
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:39,470
and these five-- E, K, Q, N,
H, I-- static evaluations.

1051
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,590
Because we didn't do the K.

1052
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:46,010
Or we might have
saved ourselves.

1053
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,970
Because maybe we were
smart and decided

1054
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:51,899
to cache the static values when
we were going down the tree.

1055
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:54,440
It's an implementation detail
that on this test when we asked

1056
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,210
that question we didn't say.

1057
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:58,400
What I mean by cache is
when we did it here and saw

1058
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,540
that E was a 2, and
then here-- oh, we

1059
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,990
have to do the static value
at E. If we were smart,

1060
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,520
we might have made a little
hash table or something

1061
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,985
and put down 2 so we didn't have
to do a static evaluation at E.

1062
00:46:09,985 --> 00:46:12,602
And if that happened,
well, we save E, H, and I,

1063
00:46:12,602 --> 00:46:15,270
and we do three fewer.

1064
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,660
Does everyone see that?

1065
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,177
However, that's
still more than six.

1066
00:46:18,177 --> 00:46:19,260
So it didn't save us time.

1067
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,051
So you might say, oh,
progressive deepening

1068
00:46:21,051 --> 00:46:22,250
is a waste of time.

1069
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,670
But it's not.

1070
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:28,050
Because this is a very, very
small, not very branchy tree

1071
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:30,750
that was made so that
you guys could easily

1072
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:34,060
do alpha-beta and take the
quiz, and it wouldn't be bad.

1073
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:40,120
If this was actually branching
even double at each level,

1074
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:44,310
it would have, what, 16 nodes
down here at the bottom.

1075
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:47,390
Then you would want to be doing
that progressive deepening.

1076
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:51,360
So now I ask you a
conceptual riddle question.

1077
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,180
It's not really that
much of a riddle.

1078
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,846
But we'll see if
anyone wants to answer.

1079
00:46:54,846 --> 00:46:57,670
Again, I won't call
on you for this.

1080
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:59,730
According to this
test, a student

1081
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,730
named Steve says,
OK, I know I have

1082
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:05,320
to pay to do the
progressive deepening here.

1083
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,490
But let's ignore that.

1084
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,320
Because it's small in
a large tree, right?

1085
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,320
It's not going to
take that much.

1086
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,720
Let's ignore the costs of
the progressive deepening

1087
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,450
and only look at
how much we do here.

1088
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,920
He says, when it comes to
performing the alpha-beta

1089
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,220
on the final level,
I'm guaranteed

1090
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,600
to always prune at
least as well or better

1091
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,970
if I rearrange the nodes
based on the best result

1092
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,830
from progressive deepening.

1093
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:28,759
Do you agree?

1094
00:47:28,759 --> 00:47:31,876


1095
00:47:31,876 --> 00:47:32,751
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1096
00:47:32,751 --> 00:47:34,250
PROFESSOR: Can I repeat it?

1097
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,850
OK, the question is,
ignoring the cost

1098
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,170
that we pay progressively
deepening here-- just

1099
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:42,295
forget about it-- at the final
step, at the final iteration,

1100
00:47:42,295 --> 00:47:45,590
the question is, am I
guaranteed to do at least as

1101
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,530
well or better in my
alpha-beta pruning

1102
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:51,137
when I reorder based
on the best order

1103
00:47:51,137 --> 00:47:52,220
for progressive deepening?

1104
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,935
Here certainly we did.

1105
00:47:53,935 --> 00:47:57,020
But the question is,
is Steve guaranteed?

1106
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,526
Answer?

1107
00:47:58,526 --> 00:47:59,675
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1108
00:47:59,675 --> 00:48:00,841
PROFESSOR: What did you say?

1109
00:48:00,841 --> 00:48:02,162
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1110
00:48:02,162 --> 00:48:03,870
PROFESSOR: That's the
answer and the why,

1111
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:05,150
which we asked to explain.

1112
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:08,160
The answer we got is, doesn't
that depend on the heuristic?

1113
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,025
Perfectly correct.

1114
00:48:09,025 --> 00:48:11,130
The answer is, no,
we're not guaranteed,

1115
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:12,780
and it depends on the heuristic.

1116
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,920
So if we were
guaranteed, that would

1117
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,310
be our heuristic was
godlike, like this heuristic.

1118
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:18,960
If your heuristic
already tells you

1119
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,180
the correct answer no matter
what, don't do game search.

1120
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,340
Just go to the
empty chess board,

1121
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,170
put all the pieces
in the front rows,

1122
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:29,990
and run static
evaluator on that.

1123
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,110
And it'll say, oh, it looks
like with this game not

1124
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:36,466
started that white is stupid,
so black will win in 15 turns.

1125
00:48:36,466 --> 00:48:37,340
And then you're done.

1126
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,690
And you don't do a search.

1127
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:41,290
We know that our heuristic
is flawed in some way.

1128
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:42,790
It could be very flawed.

1129
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:44,850
If it's flawed so
badly that it tells us

1130
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:47,320
a very bad result of what's
actually going to happen,

1131
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,646
even though we think the
minimizer is going to go to H,

1132
00:48:49,646 --> 00:48:52,070
maybe it's wrong by a
lot and it goes to G.

1133
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:54,590
It could take us up
an even worse path

1134
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,180
and make us take longer.

1135
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:56,972
Question?

1136
00:48:56,972 --> 00:48:58,506
AUDIENCE: If it's
the heuristic, how

1137
00:48:58,506 --> 00:48:59,804
could you cache the
values so you didn't

1138
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:01,096
have to recalculate them later?

1139
00:49:01,096 --> 00:49:02,720
PROFESSOR: The question
is, how can you

1140
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,780
cache the values if it's
a heuristic so you don't

1141
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,390
have to recalculate them later?

1142
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:09,770
The answer is, it wouldn't
help if there weren't

1143
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:11,780
these weird multi-level
things where

1144
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,860
we stop at E for some reason,
even though it goes down

1145
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,270
to five levels.

1146
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,430
The way you could cache
it is it is a heuristic.

1147
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:20,635
But it's consistent.

1148
00:49:20,635 --> 00:49:22,960
And I don't mean
consistent from search.

1149
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,890
I mean it's a consistent
heuristic in-- the game state

1150
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:29,190
E is, let's say that's the
state where I moved out

1151
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,530
my knight as the maximizer,
and the minimizer said,

1152
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:33,270
you're doing the
knight opening, really,

1153
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,820
and then did a counterattack.

1154
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,740
No matter how we
get to E, or where

1155
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,980
we go to get to E, that's
always going to be state E.

1156
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,430
It's always going to have
the same heuristic value.

1157
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:46,730
It's not like some guy who goes
around and just randomly pulls

1158
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:49,007
a number out of a hat.

1159
00:49:49,007 --> 00:49:50,840
We're going to have
some value that gives us

1160
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,510
points based on
state E. And it's

1161
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:54,670
going to be the same
any time we go to state

1162
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:57,020
E. Does that make sense?

1163
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:57,980
It is a heuristic.

1164
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,250
But it's always going to give
the same value at E no matter

1165
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,500
how you got to E.

1166
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,705
But it could be really bad.

1167
00:50:05,705 --> 00:50:07,330
In fact, you might
consider a heuristic

1168
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,830
that's the opposite of correct
and always tells us the worst

1169
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:11,112
move and claims it's the best.

1170
00:50:11,112 --> 00:50:13,070
That's the heuristic that
the minimizer program

1171
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:14,860
did to our computer, perhaps.

1172
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:17,450
In that case, when we do
progressive deepening and we

1173
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:22,100
reorder, we'll probably get
the worst pruning possible.

1174
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:22,880
We might not.

1175
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,830
But we may.

1176
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:26,560
So in that case,
you're not guaranteed.

1177
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,450
I hope that's given a few clues.

1178
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,090
In tutorial, you
guys are going to see

1179
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,500
some more interesting
problems that

1180
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,870
go into a few other details.

1181
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:36,160
I at least plan on doing
[INAUDIBLE] interesting game

1182
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:41,649
problem from last year, which
asked a bunch of varied things

1183
00:50:41,649 --> 00:50:43,440
that are a little bit
different from these.

1184
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,360
So it should be a lot of fun,
hopefully, or at least useful,

1185
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,910
to do the next quiz.
