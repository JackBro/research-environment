10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,750
PROFESSOR: So today
is going to be

11
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,600
our last pass at bound states.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,750
So starting next week or
actually starting next lecture,

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,389
we're going to
look at scattering.

14
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:35,680
Scattering's going to be great.

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,970
But we need to close
out bound states.

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:45,600
So today's topic
is the finite well,

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,695
finite the potential well.

18
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:52,892

19
00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:54,350
We've sort of
sketched this when we

20
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,560
looked at qualitative structure
of wave functions of energy

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,060
eigenstates.

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,280

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,090
But we're going to
solve the system today.

24
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,830

25
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,220
So good.

26
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,185
So the system we're
interested in is going to be--

27
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:15,560
The system we're
interested in is

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,009
going to be a system
with a finite depth

29
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:18,800
and a finite width.

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,531
And I'll go into detail and
give you parameters in a bit.

31
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:23,030
But first I want
to just think about

32
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,020
how do we find energy
eigenfunctions of a potential

33
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,470
of this form, v of x, which
is piecewise constant.

34
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,370
So first off, is this is a
terribly realistic potential?

35
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,360
Will you ever in the
real world find a system

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,560
that has a potential which
is piecewise constant?

37
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,210
Probably not.

38
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,310
It's discontinuous.

39
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,840
Right?

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,210
So it's rather unphysical.

41
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,130
But it's a very
useful toy model.

42
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,730
So for example, if you take
a couple of capacitor plates,

43
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:52,470
then you can induce a situation
where the electric field

44
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,050
is nonzero in between
the capacitor plates

45
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,621
and zero outside of
the capacitor plates.

46
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:00,120
Right.

47
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,209
So at a superficial level,
this looks discontinuous.

48
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:05,750
It looks like the
electric field is--

49
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,276
But actually, you know
that microscopically there

50
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:08,859
are a bunch of
charges, and everything

51
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:11,250
is nice and continuous
except for the behavior

52
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,820
right at the charges.

53
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,150
So but it's reasonable
to model this

54
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,680
as a step function
for an electric field.

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,490
So this is going to
be an idealization,

56
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,660
but it's going to be a
very useful idealization,

57
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,855
the constant potential.

58
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:26,355
OK.

59
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:30,822

60
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:31,780
So what's the equation?

61
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,110
What are we trying to do?

62
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,630
We want to find the energy
eigenstates for this

63
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,190
because we want to study
the time evolution.

64
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,220
And the easiest way to solve
the Schrodinger equation,

65
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,345
the time evolution equation,
is to expand an energy

66
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:41,210
eigenstates.

67
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,220
So the equation we want to solve
is energy eigenvalue times phi

68
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,790
e of x is equal to minus
h bar squared on 2m phi

69
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,610
e phi prime plus v of x.

70
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,820

71
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,900
And I'm going to put it in
the form we've been using.

72
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,910
Phi prime prime e of x
is equal to 2m upon h bar

73
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,980
squared v of x minus e.

74
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,480
OK.

75
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,862
So this is the
form that I'm going

76
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,278
to use today to solve for the
energy eigenvalue equations.

77
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:19,890
e is some constant.

78
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,130
Do you expect the allowed
energies to be arbitrary?

79
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,630
No.

80
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,567
They should be discrete.

81
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:29,150
Yeah, exactly.

82
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,040
So we expect that there should
be discrete lowest energy

83
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,730
state, some number
of bound states.

84
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,850
And then, eventually,
if the energy

85
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,220
is greater than the
potential everywhere,

86
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,030
the energies will be continuous.

87
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,035
Any energy will be allowed
above the potential.

88
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:52,240
So we'll have a continuum of
states above the potential.

89
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,650
And we'll have a discrete
set of bound states--

90
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,000
Probably, it's reasonable
to expect some finite number

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,416
of bound states
just by intuition.

92
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,240

93
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,860
--from the infinite well.

94
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,460
So we expect to have a finite
number of discrete energies

95
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,890
and then a continuous set
of energies above zero.

96
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,250
So if this is the asymptotic
value potential of zero.

97
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:14,750
OK.

98
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,566
And this is intuition
gained from our study

99
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:18,649
of qualitative structure
of energy eigenfunctions.

100
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,390
So we are going to talk
today about the bound states.

101
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,980
And in recitation,
leaders should

102
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,720
discuss the continuum
above zero energy.

103
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,440
OK.

104
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,340
So to solve for the actual
energy eigenfunctions

105
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,750
and the energy eigenvalues,
what we need to do

106
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:44,830
is we need to
solve this equation

107
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,900
subject to some
boundary conditions.

108
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,233
And the boundary conditions
we're going to want to solve

109
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:51,240
are going to be finite.

110
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,490
So it's normalizable infinity.

111
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,640
The solution should
be vanishing far away.

112
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,390
And the wave function
should be everywhere smooth.

113
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,059
Well, at least it
should be continuous.

114
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:02,350
So let's talk about what
exactly boundary conditions we

115
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:02,974
want to impose.

116
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:05,770

117
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,290
And so in particular,
we're going

118
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,870
to want to solve for the energy
eigenfunctions in the regions

119
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,150
where the potential is constant
and then patch together

120
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,460
solutions at these boundaries.

121
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,749
We know how to solve for
the energy eigenfunctions

122
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:22,040
when the potential is constant.

123
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,498
What are the energy
eigenfunctions?

124
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:26,501

125
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah.

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,420
Suppose I have a potential,
which is constant.

127
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,564
v is equal to 0.

128
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:31,980
What are the energy
eigenfunctions

129
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,065
of this potential?

130
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:34,220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

131
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,031
PROFESSOR: Yeah, e to the ikx.

132
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:36,530
Yeah.

133
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,988
Now, what if I
happen to tell you--

134
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:41,315
So we're at h bar
squared k squared upon 2m

135
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:42,829
is equal to the energy.

136
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:45,120
Suppose I happen to tell you
that here's the potential.

137
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,730
And I want to find the
solution in this region

138
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,397
where the energy is here
less than the potential.

139
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:51,355
What are the solutions?

140
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:54,017

141
00:05:54,017 --> 00:05:55,850
That's a second order
differential equation.

142
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,670
There should be two solutions.

143
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,500
What are the solutions to that
differential equation when

144
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,083
the energy is less
than the potential?

145
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,689

146
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:04,980
AUDIENCE: Decaying and growing.

147
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,855
PROFESSOR: Decaying and
growing exponentials.

148
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:11,930
Exactly. e to the plus alpha
x and e to the minus alpha x.

149
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,720
And the reason is
these are sinusoidal,

150
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,320
and these have the
opposite concavity.

151
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,551
They are growing and
dying exponentials.

152
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:22,185
Cool?

153
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:22,685
OK.

154
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:24,163
So we've studied that.

155
00:06:24,163 --> 00:06:25,030
Yeah?

156
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,412
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't
that be a phi e of x?

157
00:06:27,412 --> 00:06:28,120
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

158
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,510
Oh, oh, yes, indeed.

159
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,150
Sorry.

160
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,470
Thank you.

161
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,600
Phi e of x.

162
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
It's early, and I'm still
working on the coffee.

163
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,310

164
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,390
It won't take long.

165
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:46,120

166
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,620
Good.

167
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,520
So we know how to solve the
energy eigenvalue equation

168
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,990
in all these regions where
the potential is constant.

169
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,690
So our job is going to be to
find a solution where we patch

170
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,482
them together at
these interfaces.

171
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,440
We patch them together.

172
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,520
And what condition
should we impose?

173
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,250
So the basic condition
is going to be

174
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:13,580
continuity of the wave
functions phi e of x.

175
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,980
And so what are the
conditions that we need?

176
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,380
Well, if v of x--

177
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,210
Here's the way I like
to think about this.

178
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,550
Suppose v of x is continuous.

179
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:26,040

180
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,512
So if the potential
is continuous, then

181
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:29,220
what can you say?

182
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,450
You can say that phi prime prime
is a continuous function times

183
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,635
phi of x.

184
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:37,260
So very roughly, if
we look at a region

185
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,860
where phi isn't varying
very much, so if we

186
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,540
have a potential that's
varying in some way, then

187
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,890
phi prime prime, in a
region where it's not

188
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,310
varying much compared to its
value as a function of x,

189
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,960
does something
smooth because it's

190
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,050
varying with the potential.

191
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,510
And so phi prime,
which is just going

192
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,770
to be the integral of this--

193
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,145
The integral of
a smooth function

194
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:02,810
is again a smooth function.

195
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,980
--and phi, the integral
of that function

196
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,150
is also going to be a
nice, smooth function.

197
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,710
OK?

198
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,320
I've drawn it badly, but--

199
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,430
So the key thing here is that
if the potential is continuous,

200
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,360
then the energy eigenfunction
has a second derivative, which

201
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,914
is also continuous.

202
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:21,830
That means its first
derivative is continuous.

203
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,830
So that means the function
itself is continuous.

204
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,720

205
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,240
Everyone agree with this?

206
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,262
Questions?

207
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:33,220
So in regions where the
potential's continuous,

208
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,344
the wave function and its
first two derivatives all

209
00:08:35,344 --> 00:08:36,816
have to be continuous.

210
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,980
On the other hand, suppose
the potential has a step.

211
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,209
v of x has a step discontinuity.

212
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:45,480

213
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,030
OK.

214
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,190
So the potential
does one of those.

215
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,399

216
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,440
So what does that tell
you about phi prime prime?

217
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,416

218
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,290
It's a function of x.

219
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:03,444

220
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:05,360
So for example, let's
look at that first step.

221
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,420
Suppose the potential is that
first step down by some amount.

222
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,390
Then phi prime prime is going
to decrease precipitously

223
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,745
at some point.

224
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:15,370
And the actual amount
that it decreases

225
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,300
depends on the value of
phi because the change

226
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,770
in the potential time is
the actual value of phi.

227
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,730
And if that's true of
phi prime prime what can

228
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,629
you say of phi prime?

229
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:25,670
So this is discontinuous.

230
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,900

231
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,960
Phi prime of x,
however, is the integral

232
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,627
of this discontinuous function.

233
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:36,460
And what does it do?

234
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,335
Well, it's linearly
increasing in this region

235
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:40,340
because its derivative
is constant.

236
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,410
And here, it's linearly
increasing less.

237
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,590
So it's not differentiably
smooth, but it's continuous.

238
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,060
And then let's look at the
actual function phi of x.

239
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,770

240
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,270
OK.

241
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:57,978
What is it doing?

242
00:09:57,978 --> 00:09:59,430
Well, it's quadratic.

243
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,907
And then here it's quadratic
a little less afterwards.

244
00:10:02,907 --> 00:10:04,490
But that still
continuous because it's

245
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,642
the integral of a
continuous function.

246
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:09,150
Everyone we cool with that?

247
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,150
So even when we have a step
discontinuity in our potential,

248
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,470
we still have that
our derivative

249
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,685
and the value of the
function are continuous.

250
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:19,240

251
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,210
Yeah?

252
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:26,340
However, imagine the potential
has this delta function.

253
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,200
Let's just really push it.

254
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,330
What happens if our potential
has a delta function

255
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,616
singularity?

256
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:32,740
Really badly discontinuous.

257
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:39,424
Then what can you say about phi
prime prime as a function of x?

258
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:40,840
So it has a delta
function, right?

259
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,650
So the phi prime prime has to
look like something relatively

260
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,580
slowly varying, and then
a step delta function.

261
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,070
So what does that tell you
about the derivative of the wave

262
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,799
function?

263
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,840
It's got a step function.

264
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,190
Exactly.

265
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,689
Because it's the integral of
this, and the integral is 0, 1.

266
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,810

267
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,310
Whoops.

268
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,810
I missed.

269
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:06,510

270
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,660
So this is a delta.

271
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,796
This is a step.

272
00:11:09,796 --> 00:11:11,170
And then the wave
function itself

273
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,615
is, well, it's the integral
of a step, so it's continuous.

274
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:18,840

275
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,960
Sorry.

276
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,430
It's certainly not
differentiable.

277
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,763
Its derivative is discontinuous.

278
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:26,964

279
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:28,880
Well, it's differentiable
but its derivative's

280
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,671
not supposed to be.

281
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:31,110
It is not continuous, indeed.

282
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,750
So this is continuous.

283
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,670
So we've learned something
nice, that unless our potential

284
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,100
is so stupid as to have
delta functions, which

285
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,690
sounds fairly unphysical--

286
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,650
We'll come back to that
later in today's lecture.

287
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,900
--unless our potential
has delta functions,

288
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,473
the wave function and its first
derivative must be smooth.

289
00:11:50,473 --> 00:11:51,160
Yeah.

290
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,590
This is just from the
energy eigenvalue equation.

291
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,589
Now, we actually argued this
from the well definedness

292
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:58,130
and the finiteness
of the expectation

293
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,800
value of the momentum
earlier in the semester.

294
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,992
But I wanted to give
you this argument for it

295
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:04,700
because it's going to
play a useful role.

296
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,040
And it also tells us that if
we do have a delta function

297
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,510
singularity in the
potential, then the upshot

298
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,234
is that the wave function
is going to be continuous,

299
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,650
but its first
derivative will not.

300
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,935
Its first derivative will
jump at the wave function.

301
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:19,560
And that means that
the wave function--

302
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,250
Let me draw this
slightly differently.

303
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,790
--the wave function
will have a kink.

304
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,080
Its derivative will
not be continuous.

305
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,580
OK.

306
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,330
So anywhere where we
have a delta function

307
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,760
in the potential, we will have
a kink in the wave function

308
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,630
where the first derivative
is discontinuous.

309
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,470
Cool?

310
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,410
Yeah.

311
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,022
AUDIENCE: What does
that mean as far

312
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:41,017
as the expectation
value of the momentum?

313
00:12:41,017 --> 00:12:42,850
PROFESSOR: Ah, that's
an excellent question.

314
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,582
So what do you expect to
happen at such a point?

315
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:48,470
AUDIENCE: Well, your
momentum blows up.

316
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,511
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

317
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:51,520
So we're going to
have some pathologies

318
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,569
with expectation
values in the momentum.

319
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:56,110
Let's come back to that when we
talk about the delta function

320
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,360
potential, which should
be at the end of today.

321
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,480
Hold that question in
the back of your head.

322
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,580
It's a good question.

323
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,430
Other questions?

324
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,020
OK.

325
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,426
So what we're going to do now
is we're going to use, you know,

326
00:13:07,426 --> 00:13:10,960
math to find the
energy eigenfunctions

327
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,766
and eigenvalues for the
finite well potential, i.e.

328
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:15,640
we're going to solve
this equation contingent

329
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,330
on the boundary
conditions that the wave

330
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,480
function and its derivative
are smooth everywhere.

331
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,389
And in particular, they must
be smooth here and here.

332
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:24,180
I mean they've got to
be smooth everywhere.

333
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,790
We know what the
solution is inside here.

334
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,331
We know what the
solution is in here.

335
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:30,180
All we have to worry about is
what happens at the interface.

336
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,830
And we're going to use
smoothness of the wave function

337
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,510
and its derivative to
impose conditions that

338
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,950
allow us to match
across that step.

339
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,710
Everyone cool with that?

340
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,540
OK.

341
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,320
So let's do it.

342
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,812
By the way, just
a quick side note.

343
00:13:46,812 --> 00:13:48,020
Let me give you a definition.

344
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,090
I've used this
phrase many times,

345
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,881
but I haven't given
you a definition of it.

346
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:53,260
So I've used the
phrase, bound state.

347
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,560
And its opposite is
called a scattering state.

348
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,204
So here's what I mean
by a bound state.

349
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,620
Intuitively, a
bound state, if you

350
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,161
think about this
classically, imagine

351
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:02,220
I have a potential well.

352
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,910
And I have a marble,
and I let go from here.

353
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,220
This marble is bound.

354
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,720
Right?

355
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,178
It's never getting
out of the well.

356
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:09,073
It's stuck.

357
00:14:09,073 --> 00:14:10,040
Yeah?

358
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,130
And so I would call
that a bound marble.

359
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,180
On the other hand, a marble
that I give a huge kick to,

360
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,240
big velocity so
that it can get out,

361
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,400
well then it's not bound
to this potential well.

362
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,910
So I'll call that a scattering
state just to give it a name.

363
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,760
And next lecture we'll see why
we call it a scattering state.

364
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,032
The important thing is
that bound configurations

365
00:14:30,032 --> 00:14:31,490
of a classical
potential are things

366
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,870
basically in a well
that are stuck.

367
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,370
OK.

368
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,786
So the quantum version of that
statement is the following.

369
00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:39,142
Suppose I take this
potential, and I

370
00:14:39,142 --> 00:14:41,350
treat it quantum mechanically,
and I consider a state

371
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,780
with total energy like this.

372
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,760
Well, among other
things, the total energy

373
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,290
is less than the value of
the potential asymptotically

374
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:49,847
far away.

375
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,430
So what is the form
of a wave function

376
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,529
in this region with this energy?

377
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:55,320
Exponential, right?

378
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,770
It's e to the
minus some alpha x,

379
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,440
where alpha squared is roughly
the difference, alpha x.

380
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,009
And out here it's going to
be e to the plus alpha x.

381
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:06,300
And that's for normalizability.

382
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,540
We want to have a single
particle in this state.

383
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,220
So what that tells us is that
the wave function falls off

384
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,550
in these classically disallowed
regions exponentially.

385
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,510
And so the probability
of measuring the particle

386
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:27,360
at an arbitrarily far
position goes to zero.

387
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,640
And it goes to zero
exponentially rapidly.

388
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,140
Cool?

389
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,030
So I will call a bound state, a
quantum bound state, an energy

390
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:38,300
eigenstate, such that
the probability falls off

391
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,252
exponentially as we go far
away from wherever we think

392
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:44,460
is an interesting point,
like the bottom of the well.

393
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,340
Cool?

394
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,960
A bound state is
just a state which

395
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,720
is exponentially localized.

396
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,760
If you put it there,
it will stay there.

397
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,680
Yeah.

398
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,680
And it's important that
when I say a bound state

399
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,810
I'm talking about
energy eigenstates.

400
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,455
And the reason is this.

401
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:01,320
Bound state equals
energy eigenstate.

402
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,890

403
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,630
The reason is that,
consider by contrast

404
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,610
a free particle,
so a free particle

405
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,230
with constant potential.

406
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,790
What are the wave functions?

407
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,340
What are the energy
eigenfunctions?

408
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,670
Well, they're plane waves.

409
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,170
Right.

410
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,860
So are these bound states?

411
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,360
No.

412
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:20,700
Good.

413
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,000
OK.

414
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,458
On the other hand,
I claimed that I

415
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:27,180
can build a wave packet, a
perfectly reasonable wave

416
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,600
packet, which is a Gaussian.

417
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,780
OK.

418
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,940
This is some wave
function, psi of x times 0.

419
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,630
It's a Gaussian.

420
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,630
It's nice and narrow.

421
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,350
Is that a bound state?

422
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,550
Well, it's localized
at this moment in time.

423
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,880
But will it remain, and in
particular its probability

424
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,470
distribution, which
is this thing norm

425
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,980
squared is localized in space--

426
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,480
Sorry.

427
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,237
This was zero.

428
00:16:55,237 --> 00:16:56,320
--it's localized in space.

429
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,270
The probability of
it being out here

430
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,527
is not just
exponentially small, it's

431
00:16:58,527 --> 00:17:00,277
Gaussian so it's e to
the minus x squared.

432
00:17:00,277 --> 00:17:02,560
It's really not out here.

433
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,329
But what happens if I let go?

434
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:08,019
What happens if I look
at the system at time t?

435
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:09,060
It's going to spread out.

436
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,650
It's going to disperse.

437
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,816
We're going to talk about
that in more detail later.

438
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:13,339
So it's going to spread out.

439
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:18,030
And eventually, it will get
out arbitrarily far away

440
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,670
with whatever probably you like.

441
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,538
So the probability distribution
is not time invariant.

442
00:17:23,538 --> 00:17:25,329
That is to say it's
not a stationary state.

443
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,780
It's not an energy eigenstate.

444
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,140
Saying something is bound
means that it never gets away.

445
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,071
So bound states are
specifically energy eigenstates

446
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:35,820
that are strictly
localized, that fall off

447
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,870
at least exponentially as
we go away from the origin.

448
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,780
Cool?

449
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,110
It's just terminology, what
I mean by a bound state.

450
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,760
Questions?

451
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,280
OK.

452
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,840
So let's talk about
the finite well.

453
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,680

454
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,690
So I need to give you
definitions of the parameters.

455
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,520
Let's draw this more precisely.

456
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,850
Here's my well.

457
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,920
Asymptotically, the
potential is zero.

458
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,010
The potential depth, I'm
going to call minus v naught.

459
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:07,630
OK.

460
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,060
And I'm going to center
the well around zero.

461
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,330
And I'll call the
sides minus l and l.

462
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:18,590

463
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,020
And I want to find bound
states of this potential,

464
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,880
just like we found bound states
of the harmonic oscillator,

465
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,400
i.e.

466
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,780
states with energy e,
which is less than zero.

467
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,640
So these are going to give
us bound states because we're

468
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,910
going to have exponential
fall offs far away.

469
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,830

470
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,120
So a couple of things to note.

471
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,494
The first is on,
I think, problem

472
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,080
set three or four you
showed that if you

473
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,540
have a potential,
which is symmetric,

474
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,935
which is even, under x goes
to minus x, then every energy

475
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:51,060
eigenfunction, or at least
every bound state energy

476
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,890
eigenfunction, every energy
eigenfunction can be written

477
00:18:53,890 --> 00:19:02,450
as phi e symmetric or
phi e anti-symmetric.

478
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,940
So it's either even or odd.

479
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,880

480
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,122
It's either even or odd under
the exchange of x to minus x.

481
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:11,580
So when our potential
is symmetric,

482
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,590
the wave function or the
energy eigenfunctions

483
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,410
are either symmetric
or anti-symmetric.

484
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,580
OK.

485
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,880
So we want to solve for
the actual eigenfunctions.

486
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,745
So we want to solve
that equation.

487
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:25,930

488
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,300
And we have this
nice simple fact

489
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,440
that we know the
solutions in this region.

490
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,820
We know the general
solution in this region.

491
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,653
We know the general
solution in this region.

492
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:38,189
So I'm going to call these
regions one, two, and three,

493
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:39,230
just to give them a name.

494
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,290
So in region one--

495
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,430

496
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,290
That's actually sort of stupid.

497
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,304
Let's call this inside,
left, and right.

498
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:49,804
Good.

499
00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:54,730

500
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,230
OK.

501
00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:02,730
So let's look at this equation.

502
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,610

503
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,170
We have two cases.

504
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:13,220
If the energy is greater than
the potential in some region,

505
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,020
then this is of the
form phi prime prime

506
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,050
is equal to energy
greater than potential.

507
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,635
This is a negative number.

508
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:24,050

509
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:29,136
And so this is a
minus k squared phi.

510
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:31,750
And we get exponentials.

511
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:38,450
And if, on the other hand,
e is less than v of x, then

512
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:45,530
phi prime prime is equal
to plus alpha squared phi.

513
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,570
I should say oscillator.

514
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:54,240

515
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,120
And in particular here, I want
the k squared is equal to 2m

516
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,130
upon h bar squared.

517
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,860
It's just the
coefficient v minus e.

518
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:17,330
And alpha squared is equal to
2m over h bar squared e minus v.

519
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:17,830
OK.

520
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,510
So let's apply that here.

521
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,294
So in this region, we're
going to get oscillations

522
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:24,460
because we're in a classically
allowed region, where

523
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,168
the energy is greater
than the potential.

524
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:27,870
So we'll get
oscillatory solutions.

525
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,390
And the salient value
of k inside, is k

526
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:39,120
is equal to the square root
of 2m over h bar squared times

527
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,940
v minus e.

528
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,255
So that's minus v naught.

529
00:21:42,255 --> 00:21:48,920

530
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,560
What did I do?

531
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,452
I did.

532
00:21:53,452 --> 00:21:54,670
It's e minus v. I thank you.

533
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,170
Yes.

534
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:59,260

535
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,170
And I want the other one to
be l so it'd be minus v. Good.

536
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:03,950
Good.

537
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,690
Excellent.

538
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,326
So root 2 over h bar squared.

539
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,950
And now we have e
minus v naught, which

540
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,520
is the actual value of
e, which is negative.

541
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,310
Right?

542
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:15,960
But minus v naught
or plus v naught

543
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,640
is positive and
greater in magnitude.

544
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,350
So this is a nice
positive number,

545
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,210
and k is the square root of it.

546
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,520
This is controlling
how rapidly the wave

547
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,720
function oscillates
in this region.

548
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,370
Similarly, out here we
have alpha is equal to--

549
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,020
Well, here the
potential is zero.

550
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,310
So it's particularly easy.

551
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,896
Alpha is equal to
the square root of 2m

552
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:41,530
upon h bar squared of--

553
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,850
Now z minus e is zero minus
e, which is a negative number.

554
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,950
So we can just write
e absolute value.

555
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:55,770

556
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:03,450
So we can write the general
solution of this eigenfunction,

557
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:11,941
of this eigenvalue equation,
as phi e of x is equal to--

558
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:13,690
Let's break it up into
inside and outside.

559
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:19,340
Well, inside we know, since it's
constant with this value of k,

560
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,055
we get superpositions of
oscillatory solutions.

561
00:23:23,055 --> 00:23:24,680
It' a second-order
difference equation.

562
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,929
There are two solutions and
two integration constants.

563
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:34,065
So first we have a cosine
of kx plus b sine kx.

564
00:23:34,065 --> 00:23:37,172

565
00:23:37,172 --> 00:23:38,610
This is inside.

566
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:44,340

567
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:52,520
And then on the left
we have a combination

568
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,770
of exponentially growing and
exponentially decreasing.

569
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,630
So the exponentially
growing is e to the alpha x

570
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,180
plus de the minus alpha x.

571
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,490
And on the right,
similarly by symmetry,

572
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,088
we have some combination of e--

573
00:24:07,088 --> 00:24:09,046
But I don't want to call
it the energy, so I'll

574
00:24:09,046 --> 00:24:10,080
call it the curly e.

575
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,005

576
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:22,240
--to the alpha x plus
fe to the minus alpha x.

577
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
OK.

578
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,630
So that's the general solution.

579
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,770
We solve the problem as a
superposition of the two

580
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,820
oscillatory solutions
or a superposition

581
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,590
of the two exponentially
growing and damped solutions

582
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,370
or exponentially
growing and collapsing

583
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,090
functions on the left and right.

584
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:42,620

585
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,400
Questions?

586
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,530
So a couple of things
to note at this point.

587
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,500

588
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,470
So the first is we have
boundary conditions to impose.

589
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,730
We have boundary conditions
at these two interfaces.

590
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,610
But we also have boundary
conditions off in infinity.

591
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,470
What are the boundary
conditions at infinity?

592
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,292
Yeah, exactly.

593
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:04,000
It should vanish.

594
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,708
So we want the system
to be normalizable.

595
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:11,610

596
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,740
So normalizable is
going to say that phi

597
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,320
goes to zero at minus infinity.

598
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:25,930
Phi of x goes to minus infinity
goes to zero, which it equals.

599
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:31,260
And phi of x goes to plus
infinity should also be zero.

600
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,110
OK.

601
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,484
And then we're
also going to have

602
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:37,454
the conditions at
the left boundary,

603
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:38,870
and we're going
to have conditions

604
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,786
at the right boundary.

605
00:25:39,786 --> 00:25:45,963

606
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:50,382
[LAUGHTER]

607
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,619
All right.

608
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:54,910
So what are the boundary
condition at the left boundary

609
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,840
condition?

610
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,830
So first off, what are
the boundary conditions

611
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,955
we want to impose at the
left and right boundaries?

612
00:26:00,955 --> 00:26:02,200
AUDIENCE: Continuous.

613
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,360
PROFESSOR: Continuous,
and the derivative

614
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,000
should be continuous.

615
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,499
Exactly.

616
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:08,060
So we have that phi is
continuous, and phi prime--

617
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,110
Good god.

618
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,960
--phi prime is continuous.

619
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,775
Similarly, phi continuous,
phi prime continuous.

620
00:26:14,775 --> 00:26:18,040

621
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,690
OK.

622
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,880
Do we have enough
boundary conditions

623
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,360
to specify our function?

624
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,910
So we have now for
our solution, we

625
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,700
have six undetermined
coefficients.

626
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,390
And we have six
boundary conditions.

627
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,549
So that looks good.

628
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:35,590
Are they all independent?

629
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,204

630
00:26:38,204 --> 00:26:38,870
Ponder that one.

631
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:43,300

632
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,960
So in particular, let's
start with the normalizable.

633
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,400
So in order for phi to go to
zero at minus infinity deep

634
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,631
out on the left,
what should be true?

635
00:26:53,631 --> 00:26:54,715
Yeah, d goes to zero.

636
00:26:54,715 --> 00:26:57,390

637
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,200
Oops, equals zero.

638
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,040
And on the right?

639
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,800
Yeah, that curly
e equals 0, which

640
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,860
is nice so I don't ever
have to write it again.

641
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,690
So that's zero.

642
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,440
And that's zero.

643
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,940
OK.

644
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,470
That's good.

645
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:16,280

646
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,754
We can take advantage
though of something nice.

647
00:27:18,754 --> 00:27:20,170
We know that the
wave function has

648
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,240
to be either symmetric
or anti-symmetric.

649
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,920
Right?

650
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,840
So we can exploit
that and say, look,

651
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,420
the wave function is going to
be different from our boundary

652
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,827
conditions, but
it's a true fact,

653
00:27:30,827 --> 00:27:32,160
and we can take advantage of it.

654
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,590
We can use the
parody of the well.

655
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,610

656
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,090
I can never--

657
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,450
So we can use the
parody of the potential

658
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:47,380
to say that the system is either
symmetric or anti-symmetric.

659
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,669
And these are often
said as even or odd

660
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,460
because the function
will be, as a function

661
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,501
of x, either even or odd.

662
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:57,150
You either pick up a
minus sign or a plus sign

663
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:00,109
under taking x to minus x.

664
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:01,650
So if the system is
even, what can we

665
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,858
say about these coefficients?

666
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:08,110

667
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,157
What must be true
of b, for example?

668
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:10,990
AUDIENCE: It's zero.

669
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,656
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

670
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,130
So b equals 0.

671
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,534
And what else?

672
00:28:14,534 --> 00:28:15,450
AUDIENCE: It equals f.

673
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,220
PROFESSOR: This equals f.

674
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:16,540
Yeah, good.

675
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,040
OK.

676
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,750
This equals f.

677
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,310
And if the system
is anti-symmetric,

678
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,440
then a equal to 0.

679
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,845
And we see that c
is equal to minus f.

680
00:28:24,845 --> 00:28:25,345
Yeah?

681
00:28:25,345 --> 00:28:28,269

682
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:29,685
So that's a useful
simplification.

683
00:28:29,685 --> 00:28:32,580

684
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,852
So it's easy to see that we
could do this either way.

685
00:28:35,852 --> 00:28:37,810
We could do either
symmetric or anti-symmetric.

686
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,476
I'm going to, for
simplicity in lecture,

687
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:41,050
focus on the even case.

688
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:45,010
b is equal to 0, and
c is equal to minus f.

689
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,650
Sorry, c is equal to f.

690
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,757
So plus c.

691
00:28:47,757 --> 00:28:50,310

692
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:55,670
So now we're
specifically working

693
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,800
with the even solutions.

694
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,179
And on your problem set,
you'll repeat this calculation

695
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:02,095
for the odd functions.

696
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:05,420

697
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,379
So we're going to focus
on the even solutions.

698
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:09,920
And now what we have
to do is we have

699
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,560
to impose the boundary
conditions for phi and phi

700
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,680
prime.

701
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,750
So that's easy enough.

702
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:23,010

703
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,525
We have the function.

704
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:28,995
All we have to do is impose
that the values are the same.

705
00:29:28,995 --> 00:29:31,495
So for example, let's focus on
the left boundary conditions.

706
00:29:31,495 --> 00:29:36,250

707
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:36,750
Sorry.

708
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,166
Let's focus on the
right because I

709
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:40,280
don't want to deal
with that minus sign.

710
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,280
So let's focus on the
right boundary conditions.

711
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,240
So this is x is equal to plus l.

712
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,900
So when x is equal to
plus l, what must be true?

713
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,150
Phi and phi prime
must be continuous.

714
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:51,820
So what's phi?

715
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,520
So phi is equal to--

716
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,540

717
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,660
Well, from inside,
it's a cosine of kl.

718
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:05,310

719
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,710
Yeah.

720
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,690
And b is gone because we're only
looking at the even functions.

721
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:15,060
On the right, however, it's
equal to c e to the minus alpha

722
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,170
l because we're evaluating
at the right boundary.

723
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,320
Yeah?

724
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,820
OK.

725
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,486
So this is cool.

726
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,720
It allows us to determine
c in terms of a.

727
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,100
And if we solve that
equation for c in terms of a,

728
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,150
we'll get an
eigenfunction, phi even,

729
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:32,760
with one overall
normalization coefficient, a.

730
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,260
And then we can fix
that to whatever

731
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,550
it has to be so that
everything integrates to one.

732
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,630
Yeah?

733
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,980
So that seems fine.

734
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,076
It seems like we can
solve for c in terms of a.

735
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:43,030
c is equal to--

736
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:46,355
This is weight.

737
00:30:46,355 --> 00:30:47,030
Well, OK.

738
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:53,890
So c is equal to a cosine
e to the plus alpha l.

739
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,002
On the other hand, we also have
a condition on the derivative.

740
00:30:57,002 --> 00:30:58,460
And the condition
on the derivative

741
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,246
is that phi prime is continuous.

742
00:31:02,246 --> 00:31:04,120
And the derivative of
this, well that's easy.

743
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,790
It's the derivative of cosine.

744
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,880
So this is going
to be minus sine.

745
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,920
But we pull out a factor
of k, because we're

746
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,420
taking derivative
with respect to x.

747
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,470
Minus k is sine of kx.

748
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,040
Evaluate it out, sine of kl, l.

749
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,930
And this is going
to be equal to minus

750
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:24,706
alpha c e to the minus alpha l.

751
00:31:24,706 --> 00:31:26,159
AUDIENCE: You forgot an a.

752
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:26,950
PROFESSOR: Oh, yes.

753
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:30,060
There should be an a.

754
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,150
Thank you.

755
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,789
OK.

756
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:34,580
So but now we've got
a problem because this

757
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:43,190
says that c is equal to minus
a times k over alpha sine

758
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,918
of kl times e to the alpha l.

759
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:51,670
And that's bad
because c can't be

760
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,350
equal to two different
numbers at the same time.

761
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,950
There's a certain monogamy
of mathematical equations.

762
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,400
It just doesn't work.

763
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,972
So how do we deal with this?

764
00:32:00,972 --> 00:32:03,055
Well, let's think about
what these equations would

765
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:03,370
have meant.

766
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,110
Forget this one for
the moment, and just

767
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,610
focus on that first expression.

768
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,240
I'm going to rewrite
this slightly.

769
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,812
a cosine of kl.

770
00:32:11,812 --> 00:32:13,120
OK.

771
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,610
So what does this
expression say?

772
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,320
Well, it seems like
it's just saying

773
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,100
if we fix c to be equal to this
value, for fixed value of kappa

774
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,810
l and alpha, then
there's a solution.

775
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,250
However, what is k?

776
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,715
What are k and alpha.

777
00:32:26,715 --> 00:32:30,420
k and alpha are
functions of the energy.

778
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,150
So it would seem from
this point of view,

779
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,830
like for any value
of the energy,

780
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:38,686
we get a solution
to this equation.

781
00:32:38,686 --> 00:32:40,150
Everyone see that?

782
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,010
But we know that can't
possibly be right

783
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,110
because we expect the
solutions to be discrete.

784
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,410
We don't expect
any value of energy

785
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,610
to lead to a solution of the
energy eigenvalue equation.

786
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,610
There should be only
discrete set of energies.

787
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,003
Yeah?

788
00:32:53,003 --> 00:32:54,669
AUDIENCE: Did you
pick up an extra minus

789
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:56,951
sign in the expression for c?

790
00:32:56,951 --> 00:32:57,700
PROFESSOR: You do.

791
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,200
Thank you.

792
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,050
The sign's cancel.

793
00:32:59,050 --> 00:32:59,737
Yes, excellent.

794
00:32:59,737 --> 00:33:01,570
I've never written this
equation in my life.

795
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,530
So thank you.

796
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,590
Yes, extra minus sign.

797
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,740
So what's going on here?

798
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,510
Well, what we see is
that we've written down

799
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,970
the general form
of the solution.

800
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:12,428
Here were imposing that we've
already imposed the condition

801
00:33:12,428 --> 00:33:14,210
that we're normalizable
at infinity.

802
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,250
Here, we're imposing
the continuity condition

803
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,400
on the right.

804
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,690
And if we impose just
the continuity condition

805
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,800
for the wave function,
we can find a solution.

806
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,420
Similarly, if we impose only
the continuity condition

807
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,170
for the derivative,
we can find a solution

808
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,860
for arbitrary values
of the energy.

809
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,900
But in order to find
a solution where

810
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:39,390
the wave function and its
derivative are both continuous,

811
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:43,059
it can't be true that the energy
takes just any value because it

812
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:45,100
would tell you that c
takes two different values.

813
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,720
Right?

814
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,260
So there's a
consistency condition.

815
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,410
For what values of energy or
equivalently, for what values

816
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,090
of k and alpha are these
two expressions equal

817
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,850
to the same thing?

818
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,214
Cool?

819
00:33:58,214 --> 00:33:59,630
So we can get that
by saying, look

820
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,050
we want both of these
equations to be true.

821
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,720
And this is easy.

822
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,510
I can take this equation and
divide it by this equation.

823
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,030
And I will lose
my coefficients c.

824
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,280
I will lose my coefficients a.

825
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,960
What do we get?

826
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,739
On the right hand side, we get--

827
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:14,929
And I'm going to put a
minus sign on everything.

828
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:18,560
So minus, minus, minus.

829
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,310
So if we take this equation and
we divide it by this equation,

830
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,040
on the right hand
side, we get alpha,

831
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,170
because the c
exponential drops off.

832
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,929
And on this side, we lose the a.

833
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:29,830
We get a k.

834
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,170
And then we get sine over
cosine of kl, also known

835
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,210
as tangent of kl.

836
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,280

837
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,080
Here we have a kl.

838
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,564
Here we have a k.

839
00:34:39,564 --> 00:34:40,980
These are all
dimensionful things.

840
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,752
Let's multiply
everything by an l.

841
00:34:43,752 --> 00:34:45,210
And this is nice
and dimensionless.

842
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,650
Both sides are dimensionless.

843
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,960
So we get this condition.

844
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,989
This is the
consistency condition,

845
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:52,530
such that both the wave
function and its derivative

846
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,230
can be continuous at
the right boundary.

847
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,650
OK?

848
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,390
And this is a pretty
nontrivial condition.

849
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,790
It says, given a value
of k, you can always

850
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:06,290
determine the value of alpha,
such as this equation as true.

851
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,300
But remember that k and
alpha are both known

852
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,450
functions of the energy.

853
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:12,440
So this is really an equation, a
complicated, nonlinear equation

854
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,220
for the energy.

855
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:17,020

856
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:23,180
So this is equal to a horrible
expression, a condition, badly

857
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,450
nonlinear, in fact,
transcendental condition

858
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,130
on the energy.

859
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,846

860
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:30,970
And where's it coming from?

861
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,860
It's coming from normalizability
and continuity everywhere.

862
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,280

863
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,020
And a useful thing
to check, and I

864
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,105
invite you to do
this on your own,

865
00:35:43,105 --> 00:35:51,020
is to check that the boundary
conditions at the left wall

866
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,305
give the same expression.

867
00:35:52,305 --> 00:35:55,870

868
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,581
Yeah.

869
00:35:57,581 --> 00:36:00,443
AUDIENCE: For our final
form of that equation,

870
00:36:00,443 --> 00:36:04,259
is there a reason that we prefer
to multiply both sides by l

871
00:36:04,259 --> 00:36:05,690
than divide both sides by k?

872
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,400
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

873
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,275
And it'll be little more
obvious in a second.

874
00:36:08,275 --> 00:36:10,920
But here's the reason.

875
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,760
So let's divide through by l.

876
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,439
This is the form that we got.

877
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,230
What are the units?

878
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,585
What are the dimensions
of this expression?

879
00:36:18,585 --> 00:36:23,140
k is a wave number, so it
has units of 1 upon length.

880
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,640
Right?

881
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,223
And that's good because that's
1 upon length times the length,

882
00:36:26,223 --> 00:36:29,370
and you'd better have something
dimensionless inside a tangent.

883
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,632
But it seems there are two
things to say about this.

884
00:36:31,632 --> 00:36:34,090
The first is it seems like l
is playing an independent role

885
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:36,200
from k in this equation.

886
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,080
But this is dimensionless.

887
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,407
These are both dimensionful
units of 1 over length.

888
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,490
So we can make the entire
expression dimensionless

889
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:46,680
and make it clear that k and l
don't have an independent life.

890
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,020
The dimensionless quantity,
kl, times the tangent

891
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,410
of that dimensionless
quantity is

892
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,129
equal to this
dimensionless quantity.

893
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:54,170
So the reason that this
is preferable is twofold.

894
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,430
First off, it makes it
sort of obvious that k

895
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,740
and l, you can't vary them
independently in this sense.

896
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:04,190
But the second is that it makes
it nice and dimensionless.

897
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,840
And you'll always,
whenever possible,

898
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,548
want to put things in
dimensionless form.

899
00:37:07,548 --> 00:37:10,434

900
00:37:10,434 --> 00:37:11,850
I mean it's just
multiplying by l.

901
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,349
So it's obviously
not all that deep.

902
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:16,960
But it's a convenient bit
of multiplication by l.

903
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,360
Other questions?

904
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,960
OK.

905
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,395
So where are we?

906
00:37:23,395 --> 00:37:25,520
So I'd like to find the
solutions of this equation.

907
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,680
So again, just to--

908
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,440

909
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:37,920
Let me write this slightly
differently where k squared is

910
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,320
equal to 2m upon h
bar squared v0 plus e.

911
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:52,420
And alpha squared is equal
to 2m upon h bar squared e,

912
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,140
the positive value of e.

913
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,670
So this is a really complicated
expression as a function of e.

914
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,980
So I'd like to solve for the
actual energy eigenvalues.

915
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,420
I want to know what are the
energy eigenvalues of the bound

916
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,654
states of the finite potential
well, as a function of l,

917
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:09,154
for example.

918
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:11,820

919
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,389
Sadly, I can't
solve this equation.

920
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:15,680
It's a transcendental equation.

921
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,570
It's a sort of canonically
hard problem to solve.

922
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,180
You can't write down a closed
from expression for it.

923
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,080
However, there are a bunch
of ways to easily solve it.

924
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,760
One is take your
convenient nearby laptop.

925
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,670
Open up Mathematica, and ask it
to numerically find solutions

926
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,170
to this.

927
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,075
And you can do this.

928
00:38:32,075 --> 00:38:32,950
It's a good exercise.

929
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,407

930
00:38:35,407 --> 00:38:37,490
I will encourage you to
do so on your problem set.

931
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,450
And in fact, on
the problem set, it

932
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,960
asks you to do a calculation.

933
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,100
And it encourages you
do it using Mathematica.

934
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,200
Let me rephrase the
statement in the problem set.

935
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,900
It would be crazy for you to
try to do it only by hand.

936
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,707
You should do it by
hand and on computer

937
00:38:50,707 --> 00:38:51,790
because they're both easy.

938
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,560
And you can check
against each other.

939
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,680
They make different
things obvious.

940
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,455
This should be your default is
to also check on Mathematica.

941
00:38:59,455 --> 00:39:02,080
The second thing we can do is we
can get a qualitative solution

942
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,890
of this equation
just graphically.

943
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,280
And since this is such a useful
technique, not just here,

944
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,122
but throughout physics
to graphically solve

945
00:39:08,122 --> 00:39:09,580
transcendental
equations, I'm going

946
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,114
to walk through it a little bit.

947
00:39:11,114 --> 00:39:13,030
So this is going to be
the graphical solution.

948
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:17,336

949
00:39:17,336 --> 00:39:18,710
And we can extract,
it turns out,

950
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:22,420
an awful lot of the
physics of these energy

951
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,700
eigenstates and their
energies through

952
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,464
this graphical technique.

953
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:28,880
So the first thing
is I write this

954
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,232
in nice, dimensionless form.

955
00:39:31,232 --> 00:39:33,440
And let me give those
dimensionless variables a name.

956
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,720
Let me call kl is equal to
z, just define a parameter z.

957
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,660
And alpha l is a parameter y.

958
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,530

959
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:48,330
And I want to note that z
squared plus y squared is

960
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:52,170
equal to a constant, which
is, I will call if you just

961
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,620
plug these guys out, kl
squared plus al squared.

962
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,320
That's easy.

963
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,460
Kl squared is this
guy times l squared.

964
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,070
Al squared is this
guy times l squared.

965
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,680
And so the e and
the minus e cancel

966
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,210
when we add them together.

967
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:09,690
So we just get 2mv0 over h
bar squared times l squared.

968
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:16,830
So 2m upon h bar
squared l squared v0.

969
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:21,420
And I'm going to call
this r naught in something

970
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,670
of a pathological
abusive notation.

971
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,170
OK.

972
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,253
So this is our expression.

973
00:40:26,253 --> 00:40:27,827

974
00:40:27,827 --> 00:40:29,660
And I actually want to
call this r0 squared.

975
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,260

976
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:32,760
I know.

977
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,540
I know.

978
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,120
It's awful.

979
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,578
But the reason I
want to do this is

980
00:40:35,578 --> 00:40:37,670
that this is the
equation for a circle.

981
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,620
Yeah?

982
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,220
And a circle has a radius.

983
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,680
The thing that goes
over here is r squared.

984
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,180
OK.

985
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,513
So at this point, you're
thinking like, come on, circle.

986
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:46,229
So let's plot it.

987
00:40:46,229 --> 00:40:48,020
So how are we going to
solve this equation?

988
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,260
Here's what I want to solve.

989
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:55,340
I have now two equations
relating z and y.

990
00:40:55,340 --> 00:41:02,020
We have that from this equation
z tangent z is equal to y.

991
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,890
And from this equation we
have that z squared plus y

992
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,980
squared is a
constant r0 squared.

993
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,892
Where r0 squared depends on
the potential and the width

994
00:41:11,892 --> 00:41:14,100
in a very specific way, on
the depth of the potential

995
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,740
and the width in a
very specific way.

996
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,580
So we want to find--

997
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,079
Bless you.

998
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:20,640
--simultaneously, we want to
find simultaneous solutions

999
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,910
of these two equations.

1000
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,720
Yeah?

1001
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,770
So that's relatively easy.

1002
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:30,300
So here's y, and here's z.

1003
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,790

1004
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,940
So this equation has solutions.

1005
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,424
Any time that y
plus z squared is

1006
00:41:38,424 --> 00:41:40,840
equal to r0 squared, that means
any time we have a circle.

1007
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:45,350
So solutions for fixed
values of r0 lie on circles.

1008
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:49,410

1009
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,853
Oh, I really should have
drawn this under here.

1010
00:41:52,853 --> 00:41:53,353
Sorry.

1011
00:41:53,353 --> 00:41:57,650

1012
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,200
y and z.

1013
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:05,760

1014
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,860
So those are the circles.

1015
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,300
Notice that I'm only focusing
on y and z, both positive.

1016
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,775
Why?

1017
00:42:12,775 --> 00:42:14,930
Not yz, but W-H-Y .

1018
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,101
Why am I focusing
on the variables y

1019
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:17,975
and z being positive?

1020
00:42:17,975 --> 00:42:21,335

1021
00:42:21,335 --> 00:42:23,710
Because we started out defining
them in terms of k and l,

1022
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,460
which were both positive,
and alpha and l,

1023
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,600
which were both positive.

1024
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,183
Can we find solutions
to this equation

1025
00:42:28,183 --> 00:42:30,100
that have x and y negative?

1026
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,850
Sure.

1027
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,040
But they don't mean anything in
terms of our original problem.

1028
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,020
So to map onto solutions
of our original problem,

1029
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,200
we want to focus on the
positive values of y and z.

1030
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,260
Cool?

1031
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,240
OK.

1032
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,260
So that's this one.

1033
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,570
The solutions lie on circles.

1034
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,130
So given a value of y, you
can find a solution of z.

1035
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:46,877
But we want to also find a
solution of this equation.

1036
00:42:46,877 --> 00:42:49,210
And this equation is a little
more entertaining to plot.

1037
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,130
Here's y.

1038
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,370
Here's z.

1039
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,370
So what does z tangent z do?

1040
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,220

1041
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,257
Oh, shoot.

1042
00:42:57,257 --> 00:42:58,340
I want to plot y vertical.

1043
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,930
Otherwise, it's going
to a giant pain.

1044
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:04,656
Happily, this plot
can be left identical.

1045
00:43:04,656 --> 00:43:05,942
Let's plot y vertically.

1046
00:43:05,942 --> 00:43:07,650
So the reason I want
to plot y vertically

1047
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,380
is that this is z tangent z.

1048
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,205
So first off, what does
tangent z look like?

1049
00:43:13,205 --> 00:43:13,864
Yeah.

1050
00:43:13,864 --> 00:43:14,530
This is awesome.

1051
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,020
Yeah, it looks like this.

1052
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:16,890
Yes, exactly.

1053
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,377
So tangent is sine over cosine.

1054
00:43:19,377 --> 00:43:20,710
Sine is zero, and cosine is one.

1055
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,870
So it does this, as
you go to a value

1056
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,170
where the argument, let's
call the argument z.

1057
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,450
So if we just plot tangent--

1058
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,080
OK.

1059
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,510
So when z is equal to pi over
2, then the denominator cosine

1060
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,205
vanishes, and that diverges.

1061
00:43:35,205 --> 00:43:39,700

1062
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,750
Oops.

1063
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,250
OK.

1064
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,960
So here's pi over 2.

1065
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,620
Here's pi.

1066
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,230
Whoops.

1067
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:54,670
Pi, pi over 2, and here's
3pi over 2, and so on.

1068
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,840
Now, we're only interested
in the first quadrant.

1069
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,540
So I'm just ignore down here.

1070
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,300
OK.

1071
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,760
So this is pi over 2.

1072
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,760
This is pi, 3pi over 2.

1073
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,832
OK.

1074
00:44:08,832 --> 00:44:10,540
But this is not what
we're interested in.

1075
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,100
We're not interested
in tangent of z.

1076
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,120
We're interested in z tangent z.

1077
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,760
And what does z
tangent z look like?

1078
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,250
Well, it's basically the same.

1079
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:18,750
Right?

1080
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,450
z tangent z, it has an
extra factor of zero here

1081
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,270
and remains extra
small at the beginning.

1082
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:25,020
But it still curves
off roughly like this.

1083
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,760
And z is just nice
and linear, nice

1084
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,940
and regular throughout this.

1085
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,481
So it doesn't change
the fact that we

1086
00:44:31,481 --> 00:44:33,350
have a divergence at pi over 2.

1087
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:36,330
And it doesn't change the fact
that it vanishes again at pi

1088
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,500
and becomes positive again.

1089
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,480
It just changes the
shape of the curve.

1090
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,030
And in fact, the way it
changes the shape of the curve

1091
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,180
is this becomes a little
fatter around the bottom.

1092
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,890
It's just a little more round.

1093
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,829
And when we get out
to large values of z,

1094
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:48,620
it's going to have a
more pronounced effect

1095
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,920
because that slope
is, at every example

1096
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,920
where it crosses z, that
slope is getting larger

1097
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,542
because the coefficient
of z is getting larger.

1098
00:44:56,542 --> 00:44:57,244
OK.

1099
00:44:57,244 --> 00:44:59,160
So it's just going to
get more and more sharp.

1100
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,090
But anyway, with all
that said, here's 0.

1101
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:03,510
Here's pi.

1102
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,470
Here's pi over 2.

1103
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,910
Here's pi.

1104
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:09,590
Here's 3pi over 2.

1105
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,799
The second plot we want
to plot, y is z tangent z.

1106
00:45:11,799 --> 00:45:12,840
We know how to plot this.

1107
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:27,390

1108
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:28,720
Cool?

1109
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,140
And what we want to find
are simultaneous solutions

1110
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:34,570
of this, values of y and z, for
which this equation is solved

1111
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,410
and this equation is solved
for the same value of y and z.

1112
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:40,640
This is a graphical solution.

1113
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,080
So let's combine them together.

1114
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,610
And the combined
plots look like this.

1115
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,900
First we have pi over 2.

1116
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,600

1117
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,930
So let's plot the tangents.

1118
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:57,780

1119
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,557
And then we have these circles
for various values of r.

1120
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,390
So for a particular
value of r, for example,

1121
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:05,920
suppose this is the value of r.

1122
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,610
This is r0.

1123
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:12,100

1124
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,250
So how many
solutions do we have?

1125
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,082
One.

1126
00:46:16,082 --> 00:46:18,310
One set of common
points where at y and z

1127
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:19,185
solve both equations.

1128
00:46:19,185 --> 00:46:22,620

1129
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,962
So we immediately learn
something really lovely.

1130
00:46:25,962 --> 00:46:27,670
What happens to the
radius of that circle

1131
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:28,753
as I make the well deeper?

1132
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:32,294

1133
00:46:32,294 --> 00:46:35,124
Yeah, as I make the well
deeper, that means v0 gets

1134
00:46:35,124 --> 00:46:37,290
larger and larger magnitude,
the radius gets larger.

1135
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,081
So does the circle.

1136
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:40,730
So if I make the well deeper,
I make this the circle larger.

1137
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:42,345
Will I still have a solution?

1138
00:46:42,345 --> 00:46:43,720
Yeah, I'll still
have a solution.

1139
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,235
But check this out.

1140
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:46,485
Now, I'll have a new solution.

1141
00:46:46,485 --> 00:46:50,570

1142
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:55,200
And you can even see the
critical value of the depth

1143
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,290
and the width of the well.

1144
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:01,030
In order to have exactly a
new bound state appearing,

1145
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,890
what must the value of r0 be?

1146
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:07,951
Well, it's got to be that value,
such that r0 squared is pi.

1147
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:08,450
Yeah?

1148
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,792

1149
00:47:10,792 --> 00:47:13,000
And similarly, let me ask
you the following question.

1150
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
As I make the well deeper
and deeper and deeper,

1151
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,780
holding the width, and make it
deeper and deeper and deeper,

1152
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:20,480
does the number of states
increase or decrease?

1153
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,025
It increases.

1154
00:47:21,025 --> 00:47:22,400
If you make it
deeper and deeper,

1155
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,691
the radius of that circle is
getting bigger and bigger.

1156
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:30,010
There are more points where this
circle intersects this point.

1157
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,730
So here's another one.

1158
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:38,670
We've got one here, one here,
one here, three solutions.

1159
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:40,850
And the number of
solutions just goes.

1160
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:42,800
Every time we click
over a new point

1161
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,383
by increasing the radius of the
circle, we get a new solution.

1162
00:47:45,383 --> 00:47:46,990
We get another bound state.

1163
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,730
But here's the thing that
I really want to focus on.

1164
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,390
Let's make the well
less and less deep.

1165
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:54,060
Let's make it shallower
and shallower.

1166
00:47:54,060 --> 00:48:00,220
At what depth do we lose
that first bound state?

1167
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,131
We never do.

1168
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:01,630
Right?

1169
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,190
There is no circle
so small that it

1170
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:06,030
doesn't intersect this curve.

1171
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:09,590
In a 1D, finite well potential,
there is always at least one

1172
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:10,890
bound state.

1173
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,931
There are never
zero bound states.

1174
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,430
This will turn out not to be
true in three dimensions, which

1175
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:16,960
is kind of interesting.

1176
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,840
But it's true in one
dimension that we always

1177
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,970
have at least one bound state.

1178
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:23,800
And in fact, you
can decorate this.

1179
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,790
You can use this and
fancy it up a bit

1180
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:28,770
to argue that in
any potential in 1D,

1181
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:31,445
there's always at
least one bound state

1182
00:48:31,445 --> 00:48:32,820
unless the potential
is constant,

1183
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:36,025
I mean any potential that varies
and goes to zero infinity.

1184
00:48:36,025 --> 00:48:38,640

1185
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,405
Yeah?

1186
00:48:39,405 --> 00:48:41,030
And so we still don't
have any numbers.

1187
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,390
But we know an awful lot about
the qualitative structure

1188
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:49,476
of the set of energy eigenvalues
of the spectrum of the energy.

1189
00:48:49,476 --> 00:48:49,975
Questions?

1190
00:48:49,975 --> 00:48:52,580

1191
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,710
Yeah?

1192
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:57,081
AUDIENCE: So what
happens if r is bigger

1193
00:48:57,081 --> 00:49:03,622
than pi or y is bigger than
pi and you get two solutions?

1194
00:49:03,622 --> 00:49:04,330
PROFESSOR: Great.

1195
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,720
So when we have two solutions,
what does that mean?

1196
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,270
Well, you've got to bound
states, two different energies.

1197
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:13,175
Right?

1198
00:49:13,175 --> 00:49:14,050
It's a good question.

1199
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:17,890
Every solution here corresponds
to some particular value of y

1200
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:19,430
and some particular value of z.

1201
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,640
But those values
of y and z are just

1202
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,375
telling you what
k and alpha are.

1203
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:26,050

1204
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:27,674
And so that's
determining the energy.

1205
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:29,090
So a different
value of k is going

1206
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:30,941
to give you a different
value of the energy.

1207
00:49:30,941 --> 00:49:32,690
So we can just eyeball
this in particular.

1208
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:33,780
Let's look at alpha.

1209
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,020
Alpha is just e.

1210
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,090
Alpha squared is just e.

1211
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:37,716
Yes?

1212
00:49:37,716 --> 00:49:38,840
So here's a quick question.

1213
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,920
If alpha is just e,
and alpha l is y--

1214
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,060
So this is our y value.

1215
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:46,350
y is roughly alpha,
the width, which

1216
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,450
means it's roughly the
energy square root.

1217
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,720
So this value,
the vertical value

1218
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,760
of each of these intersection
points on a given circle

1219
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,030
corresponds to the
square root of the energy

1220
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,700
times some coefficients.

1221
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:04,671
So which state has the
largest value of the energy?

1222
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,420
Absolute value, which
state is most deeply

1223
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,577
bound on this circle?

1224
00:50:09,577 --> 00:50:10,410
Yeah, the first one.

1225
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:10,540
Right?

1226
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,880
Because it's got the
largest value of alpha.

1227
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,630
So this is nice.

1228
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,127
We see that the
first state always

1229
00:50:14,127 --> 00:50:16,210
has a higher value of alpha
than the second state,

1230
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:18,420
which always has a higher value
of alpha than the third state.

1231
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,870
And every time we
add a new state,

1232
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:23,640
we make the depth of these
guys the binding energy

1233
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,820
of the already existing states.

1234
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,952
We make it just a
little bit deeper.

1235
00:50:27,952 --> 00:50:29,700
We make them a little
more tightly bound.

1236
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,420
And only eventually
then do we get

1237
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,890
a new bound state appearing.

1238
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:34,764
And what's the energy
of that new bound state

1239
00:50:34,764 --> 00:50:37,340
when it appears?

1240
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,300
Zero energy.

1241
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:41,200
It's appearing
just at threshold.

1242
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,010
OK.

1243
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:44,343
So we'll explore that in more
detail in the problem set.

1244
00:50:44,343 --> 00:50:45,930
But for now, let me
leave it at that.

1245
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:46,430
Questions?

1246
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:47,096
Other questions?

1247
00:50:47,096 --> 00:50:47,750
Yeah.

1248
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,708
AUDIENCE: You said that
this can be generalized

1249
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:53,250
to any nonconstant
function that you'd like.

1250
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,250
So there's always going to
be at least one bound state.

1251
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,250
What about, like
with delta function?

1252
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:58,790
PROFESSOR: Excellent question.

1253
00:50:58,790 --> 00:50:59,610
What about the delta function?

1254
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:00,420
We're going to come back to
that in just a few minutes.

1255
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,503
It's a very good question.

1256
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:04,380
So the question is, look,
if any potential that

1257
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,077
goes to zero infinity
and wiggles inside,

1258
00:51:07,077 --> 00:51:09,410
if any potential like that
in 1D has a bound state, what

1259
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:10,451
about the delta function?

1260
00:51:10,451 --> 00:51:11,730
We briefly talked about that.

1261
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:14,146
So we're going to come back
to that in just a few minutes.

1262
00:51:14,146 --> 00:51:15,361
But it's a pressing question.

1263
00:51:15,361 --> 00:51:15,860
OK.

1264
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,526
Other questions?

1265
00:51:16,526 --> 00:51:22,550

1266
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:23,572
Yes.

1267
00:51:23,572 --> 00:51:25,947
AUDIENCE: So the energy is
zero, but that's not possible.

1268
00:51:25,947 --> 00:51:28,015

1269
00:51:28,015 --> 00:51:28,890
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

1270
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:29,070
OK.

1271
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:29,240
Good.

1272
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,040
So let me talk about that
in a little more detail.

1273
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,970
So I wasn't going to
go into this, but--

1274
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:36,130
So when new bound states appear,
so let's consider a point where

1275
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:39,950
our r0 is, let's say,
it's just the right value

1276
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:43,291
so that r0 is equal to pi.

1277
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:43,790
OK.

1278
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:48,400
And we see that we're just about
to develop a new bound state.

1279
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,870
So let's think about what
that bound state looks like.

1280
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,440
So this is the new bound state.

1281
00:51:52,440 --> 00:52:00,504

1282
00:52:00,504 --> 00:52:02,170
And I'm going to put
this in parentheses

1283
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:04,545
because it's got bound state.

1284
00:52:04,545 --> 00:52:05,545
And we say at threshold.

1285
00:52:05,545 --> 00:52:09,660

1286
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,100
OK.

1287
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,124
At threshold, i.e.

1288
00:52:13,124 --> 00:52:21,199
at the energy is roughly
zero, and r0 is equal to pi.

1289
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:22,490
So this is really what we mean.

1290
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:24,030
This new state,
when r0 is pi and we

1291
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:26,600
have a solution on
that second branch.

1292
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,101
Cool?

1293
00:52:27,101 --> 00:52:28,850
So what does this wave
function look like?

1294
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,350
What does it look
like when you have

1295
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,050
a wave function
that just appeared?

1296
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,252
It's just barely bound.

1297
00:52:33,252 --> 00:52:35,210
Well, first off, what
does it mean to be bound?

1298
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,370
Let's just step back
and remember for now.

1299
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:37,870
What does it mean
to be a bound state?

1300
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:39,495
It means you're an
energy eigenfunction

1301
00:52:39,495 --> 00:52:40,930
and you're localized.

1302
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:43,600
Your wave function
falls off at infinity.

1303
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,070
Now, if it falls
off at infinity,

1304
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:46,554
do these guys fall
off at infinity?

1305
00:52:46,554 --> 00:52:48,095
These wave functions,
sure, they fall

1306
00:52:48,095 --> 00:52:49,940
of with an exponential damping.

1307
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,898
And in particular, let's
look at the right hand

1308
00:52:51,898 --> 00:52:52,690
side of the well.

1309
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:56,110
This new bound state is
appearing just at zero energy.

1310
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:58,130
So out here, what is
the wave function?

1311
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:59,860
It's e to the minus alpha x.

1312
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:02,560
But what's alpha?

1313
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,560
Zero, right?

1314
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,020
There it is, zero.

1315
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,572
So this is e to the minus alpha
x where alpha is equal to 0.

1316
00:53:09,572 --> 00:53:10,280
This is constant.

1317
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,040

1318
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,190
So what does the wave
function look like?

1319
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:17,540
Well, the wave function,
again over the same domain--

1320
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,360
Here's 0, l.

1321
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,607

1322
00:53:23,607 --> 00:53:24,690
And here's the value zero.

1323
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:28,184
We know that in this
domain it's oscillatory,

1324
00:53:28,184 --> 00:53:29,600
and in this domain,
it's constant.

1325
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:36,610

1326
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:40,515
And actually, since we know that
it's the first excited state,

1327
00:53:40,515 --> 00:53:42,130
we know that it does this.

1328
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:46,340

1329
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:51,990
So if we make the well
ever so slightly deeper,

1330
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:54,070
ever so slightly
deeper, which means

1331
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:57,320
making the radius of the
circle ever so slightly larger,

1332
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,450
we will get a nonzero value
for the alpha of this solution.

1333
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:00,950
Right?

1334
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,270
It'll be just tiny.

1335
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:03,637
But it'll be nonzero.

1336
00:54:03,637 --> 00:54:05,720
So we make the well just
a little tiny bit deeper.

1337
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,428
We get something.

1338
00:54:06,428 --> 00:54:08,130
OK, good.

1339
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,310
So what's going to happen
to the wave function?

1340
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,320
Well, instead of going flat.

1341
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,400
This is going to curve.

1342
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,649
It's got a little more energy.

1343
00:54:14,649 --> 00:54:16,050
There's a little more curvature.

1344
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:18,950
So it curves just a
little tiny bit more.

1345
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:21,575
And then it matches onto a very
gradually decaying exponential.

1346
00:54:21,575 --> 00:54:24,710

1347
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:25,210
OK.

1348
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:27,920
So what's happening as we take
this bound state, the second

1349
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,510
bound state, and we make the
well a little more shallow?

1350
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,450
We make the well a
little more shallow.

1351
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:34,240
It's a little less
curved inside.

1352
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,490
And the evanescent tails,
the exponential tails

1353
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:40,210
become longer and longer
and longer and broader

1354
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:43,530
until they go off to infinity,
until they're infinitely wide.

1355
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,404
And is that
normalizable anymore?

1356
00:54:45,404 --> 00:54:46,570
No, that's not normalizable.

1357
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:48,720
So the state really
isn't strictly localized

1358
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,350
at that point.

1359
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:50,990
It's not really a
normalizable state.

1360
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:54,490
And just when the state
ceases to be normalizable,

1361
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:56,627
it disappears.

1362
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,210
We make the well
just a little deeper,

1363
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,180
and there's no
state there at all.

1364
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:00,680
OK.

1365
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,179
So this tells you
a very nice thing.

1366
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:04,730
It's a good bit of intuition
that when states are appearing

1367
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:08,620
or disappearing, when states
are at threshold as you

1368
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:13,020
vary the depth, those threshold
bound states have exceedingly

1369
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:18,544
long evanescent tails, and
they're just barely bound.

1370
00:55:18,544 --> 00:55:19,087
OK?

1371
00:55:19,087 --> 00:55:21,420
This turns out to have all
sorts of useful consequences,

1372
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,290
but let me move on.

1373
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:23,800
Did that answer your question?

1374
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,300
Good.

1375
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,023
Yeah?

1376
00:55:25,023 --> 00:55:27,861
AUDIENCE: So in this case,
the radius, as you say,

1377
00:55:27,861 --> 00:55:29,753
is proportional to the length.

1378
00:55:29,753 --> 00:55:32,118
Right?

1379
00:55:32,118 --> 00:55:36,385
But also we have intuition
that as we increase

1380
00:55:36,385 --> 00:55:37,884
the length of the
well, the energy's

1381
00:55:37,884 --> 00:55:39,351
going to keep increasing--

1382
00:55:39,351 --> 00:55:41,141
PROFESSOR: Fantastic.

1383
00:55:41,141 --> 00:55:41,640
OK.

1384
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,160
So what's up with that?

1385
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,020
Right.

1386
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,020
So the question is this.

1387
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,210
We already have intuition that
is if we take a finite well

1388
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,760
and we make it a
little bit wider,

1389
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,050
the ground state
energy should decrease.

1390
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:53,550
The energy of the ground state
should get deeper and deeper,

1391
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:54,925
or the magnitude
should increase,

1392
00:55:54,925 --> 00:55:55,950
another way to say it.

1393
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:56,450
Right?

1394
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:57,470
That was our intuition.

1395
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:58,790
So let's check if that's true.

1396
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:01,790
What happens if I
take the ground state

1397
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,350
some value of the
radius, and then I

1398
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:05,077
make the well a
little bit wider.

1399
00:56:05,077 --> 00:56:06,910
Well, if I make the
well a little bit wider,

1400
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:09,080
what happens to r0, the
radius of the circle?

1401
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,020
Well, if I double the length
of the well, the width

1402
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,520
of the well, then
it will double r0,

1403
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,780
and it will double the
radius of the circle.

1404
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,142
So if I make it
wider, r0 gets bigger,

1405
00:56:18,142 --> 00:56:19,350
and we go to a bigger circle.

1406
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:23,100
And what happened to the
energy of this state?

1407
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:26,330
Yeah, it got deeper
and deeper and deeper.

1408
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:28,210
And meanwhile, as
we make it wider,

1409
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,987
as we make the well wider, the
circle is getting bigger again.

1410
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:32,820
And we're going to get
more and more states.

1411
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,200
So as we make the well wider,
holding the depth fixed,

1412
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,390
we get more and more states.

1413
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:40,210
As we make the well deeper,
holding the width fixed,

1414
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:42,110
we get more and more states.

1415
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:43,650
And so how do you trade off?

1416
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,537
If I make it twice
as wide, how much--

1417
00:56:45,537 --> 00:56:46,620
So here's a good question.

1418
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:51,140
Suppose I take a well,
and it has n states.

1419
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,720
Suppose I then make
it twice as wide.

1420
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,690
What must I do to the
energy so that it still

1421
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:59,181
has the same states
with the same energies?

1422
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:01,730
AUDIENCE: Divide it by 4.

1423
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:02,730
PROFESSOR: Yep, exactly.

1424
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:04,289
I've got to divide it by 4.

1425
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:05,830
Because I've doubled
the length, that

1426
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,600
means the radius
has gone up by four.

1427
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,200
But I get exactly
the same solutions

1428
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,700
if I just bring this out.

1429
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,570
Well, that's almost true.

1430
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:14,200
So if I put a
factor of 1/4 here,

1431
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:19,160
that's almost true, except for
the value of y is unchanged,

1432
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,391
but the alpha hasn't changed.

1433
00:57:22,391 --> 00:57:22,890
Sorry.

1434
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:24,875
The alpha has changed
because there's an l.

1435
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:25,770
So y is fixed.

1436
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:29,274
But alpha's changed
because of the l.

1437
00:57:29,274 --> 00:57:31,190
So the reason that it's
useful to write things

1438
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:33,740
in these dimensionless forms is
that you can see the play off

1439
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,550
of the various different
dimensionful parameters

1440
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:39,270
in changing the answer.

1441
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:41,210
Other questions.

1442
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:42,550
OK.

1443
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,745
So a couple of comments.

1444
00:57:43,745 --> 00:57:45,620
So the first is let's
just check to make sure

1445
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:46,630
that this makes sense.

1446
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,262
We have already
solved this problem.

1447
00:57:49,262 --> 00:57:50,720
We solved this
problem a while ago,

1448
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,950
but we solved it in
a particular limit.

1449
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:56,750
We solved it in the limit that
the potential one's arbitrarily

1450
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:58,804
deep.

1451
00:57:58,804 --> 00:58:01,039
Right?

1452
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:03,080
So when the potential
one's are arbitrarily deep,

1453
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,390
holding the width fixed,
that was the infinite well.

1454
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:07,480
That was the first
problem we solved.

1455
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,100
So let's make sure that we
recover this in that limit.

1456
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,470
So what happens as we make
the well arbitrarily deep,

1457
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:18,030
holding the length fixed
or the width fixed.

1458
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:19,680
So if we make this
arbitrarily deep,

1459
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,270
v0 is getting arbitrarily large.

1460
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:22,460
That means r0 is getting--

1461
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,410
We've got a huge circle.

1462
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:27,520
So what do these
solutions look like when

1463
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,750
we have a huge circle.

1464
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,110
Let me not do that here.

1465
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,696

1466
00:58:33,696 --> 00:58:34,985
Let me do that here.

1467
00:58:34,985 --> 00:58:38,290

1468
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:43,072
So if we make the
potential nice and deep,

1469
00:58:43,072 --> 00:58:44,905
Let's think about what
that plot looks like.

1470
00:58:44,905 --> 00:58:47,640

1471
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:51,100
So again, that first plot looks
identical with the tangents.

1472
00:58:51,100 --> 00:59:09,160

1473
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,370
So on and so forth.

1474
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:15,690
And what I want to do is
I want to dot, dot, dot.

1475
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:16,190
OK.

1476
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,280
So this is way up there.

1477
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,580

1478
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,390
So these guys are basically
vertical lines at this point.

1479
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:28,770
So for very, very large values
of y, and in particular,

1480
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:31,470
for very large values that are
of order the gigantically deep

1481
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:36,819
radius r0, what does
the circle look like?

1482
00:59:36,819 --> 00:59:39,360
So what does the second equation
look like, the second curve?

1483
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,970
Well, again it's circles.

1484
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:43,490
But now it's a gigantic circle.

1485
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:44,250
Yeah, exactly.

1486
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,370
If it's a gigantic circle,
it's basically flat.

1487
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:51,907

1488
00:59:51,907 --> 00:59:53,740
It's not exactly flat,
but it's almost flat.

1489
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:54,390
It's a circle.

1490
00:59:54,390 --> 01:00:02,620

1491
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:04,900
So what are the values?

1492
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,090
And here's the key question.

1493
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:07,400
What are the values of--

1494
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,720

1495
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,750
Did do that right?

1496
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:12,250
Yeah, OK.

1497
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:12,750
Good.

1498
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:20,010
So what are the values of the
curve, where we get a solution?

1499
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:26,436
The values now of
z, are just exactly

1500
01:00:26,436 --> 01:00:28,310
on these vertical lines,
on the separatrices.

1501
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:30,955
The value of z is at pi over 2.

1502
01:00:30,955 --> 01:00:34,410

1503
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:35,480
and 3pi over 2.

1504
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,220

1505
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:43,281
And then another one at 5pi
over 2, and so on and so forth.

1506
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:43,780
Right?

1507
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:48,694
So what we find is that
the allowed values of z--

1508
01:00:48,694 --> 01:00:49,690
Sorry.

1509
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,920
kl, yes, good.

1510
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:58,140
--allowed values of z are
equal to 2n plus 1 over pi.

1511
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,159
Whoops 2n plus 1
over 2 times pi.

1512
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:01,200
So let's just check that.

1513
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,505
So n is 0.

1514
01:01:02,505 --> 01:01:04,630
That's 0 1/2 pi.

1515
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:05,710
n is 1.

1516
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:06,831
That's 3/2 pi.

1517
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:07,330
Good.

1518
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,420
So these are the
values of z, which

1519
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:18,580
says that kl is equal to 2n plus
1 upon 2 pi or k is equal to 2n

1520
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:22,520
plus 1 over 2l, which is
the width of this well

1521
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,820
because it's from
minus l to l pi.

1522
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:29,355
So is this the correct answer
for the infinite square well?

1523
01:01:29,355 --> 01:01:33,330

1524
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:35,860
Are these the
allowed values of k

1525
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:41,330
inside the well for the
infinite square well?

1526
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:42,850
Almost.

1527
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:45,720
Instead of 2n plus 1, it
should just be n plus 1.

1528
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,596
We seem to be missing about
half of the energy eigenvalues.

1529
01:01:49,596 --> 01:01:51,096
AUDIENCE: That's
only the even ones.

1530
01:01:51,096 --> 01:01:51,870
PROFESSOR: Yeah, thank you.

1531
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:52,820
This is only the even ones.

1532
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,030
We started out saying, oh, look.

1533
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:55,510
Let's look only
at the even ones.

1534
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:58,710
Where do you think the
odd ones are going to be?

1535
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:02,450
Ah, well the odd ones,
so this should be k even.

1536
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:03,380
So what about k odd?

1537
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:04,830
Well, we know the
answer already--

1538
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:05,440
Whoops.

1539
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,820
Odd, that's an odd spelling.

1540
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:12,000
--should be equal to 2n
over 2l plus 2 over 2l.

1541
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,500
Whoops.

1542
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,561
2 capital L, pi.

1543
01:02:14,561 --> 01:02:15,060
OK.

1544
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,710
This is our guess
just from matching on

1545
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:18,902
to the infinite square well.

1546
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:19,860
So what does that mean?

1547
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,994
Well, that means it should
be this one and this one.

1548
01:02:22,994 --> 01:02:25,160
So when you go through this
exercise on your problem

1549
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,215
set and you find the
solutions for the odd,

1550
01:02:28,215 --> 01:02:30,740
and you repeat this analysis
for the odd ground states.

1551
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:31,710
What should you expect?

1552
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,400
Well, you should
expect to find this.

1553
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:37,327
And what do you
think the curves are

1554
01:02:37,327 --> 01:02:39,410
that you're going to use
int he graphical solution

1555
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:42,804
to do your
transcendental equation?

1556
01:02:42,804 --> 01:02:44,470
Yeah, it's really
tempting to say, look.

1557
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,700
It's just going to be
something shifted, like this.

1558
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,200
OK.

1559
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:53,850
So these are going to be the odd
question mark, question mark.

1560
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:55,330
OK.

1561
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:58,245
So you'll check whether that's
correct intuition or not

1562
01:02:58,245 --> 01:03:00,274
on your problem set.

1563
01:03:00,274 --> 01:03:01,230
OK.

1564
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:03,514
Questions?

1565
01:03:03,514 --> 01:03:04,014
Yeah?

1566
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:07,316
AUDIENCE: What about the lower
end of these states, where

1567
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:08,774
it won't have gone
off high enough?

1568
01:03:08,774 --> 01:03:09,730
Is that [INAUDIBLE]?

1569
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:10,605
PROFESSOR: Excellent.

1570
01:03:10,605 --> 01:03:12,930
So that's a really
good question.

1571
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:15,600
How to say it?

1572
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,649
What we've done here to
make this an infinite well--

1573
01:03:18,649 --> 01:03:20,690
So the question, let me
just repeat the question.

1574
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:24,400
The question is, look, what
about all the other states?

1575
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,110
OK, it's true that
r0 as gigantic.

1576
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:28,650
But eventually, we'll go
to a large enough z, where

1577
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:30,570
it's the circle coming
down over here too.

1578
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:31,600
So what's up with that?

1579
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,625
What are those states?

1580
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:33,250
Where are they?

1581
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,541
What do they mean in terms
if the infinite square well?

1582
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:39,798
Well, first off, what are
the energies of those states?

1583
01:03:39,798 --> 01:03:40,652
AUDIENCE: Very low.

1584
01:03:40,652 --> 01:03:42,360
PROFESSOR: They're
very low in magnitude,

1585
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,555
which means they're close
to what in absolute value?

1586
01:03:44,555 --> 01:03:45,180
AUDIENCE: Zero.

1587
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:45,550
PROFESSOR: Zero.

1588
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:46,110
They're close to zero.

1589
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:47,819
So they're at the top
of the finite well.

1590
01:03:47,819 --> 01:03:50,193
These are the states bound at
the top of the finite well.

1591
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:52,670
These are the states bound at
the bottom the finite well.

1592
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:55,824
But how many states are bound
at the top of the finite well

1593
01:03:55,824 --> 01:03:58,240
when we take the limit that
the well goes infinitely deep?

1594
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,630

1595
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:02,510
Yeah, none of them.

1596
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:02,760
Right?

1597
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,860
So when we make the
well infinitely deep,

1598
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,570
what we're saying
is, pay no attention

1599
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:07,050
to the top of the well.

1600
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,550
Look only at the
bottom of the well.

1601
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:11,607
And if it's really deep, it's
a pretty good approximation.

1602
01:04:11,607 --> 01:04:12,940
So that's what we're doing here.

1603
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:13,731
We're saying, look.

1604
01:04:13,731 --> 01:04:15,190
Pay no attention.

1605
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,960
There is no top of the well.

1606
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,960
There's just the bottom.

1607
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,030
And look at the
energy eigenvalues.

1608
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:19,880
Does that make sense?

1609
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,770
So what we're saying is if
you have a preposterously

1610
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,750
deep well, the energies
of a preposterously

1611
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,870
deep well should be
a good approximation

1612
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:29,350
to the low-lying energies
of an infinitely deep well.

1613
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:33,180
Because it's way up there,
what difference can it make?

1614
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:35,180
And that's what we're
seeing work out.

1615
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,420
Did that answer your question?

1616
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:38,350
AUDIENCE: Wait.

1617
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:39,696
I might have this backward.

1618
01:04:39,696 --> 01:04:42,070
But when it says the high
energy instead of looking right

1619
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:43,275
at the top of the well--

1620
01:04:43,275 --> 01:04:43,550
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1621
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:43,950
OK, good.

1622
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:45,730
So this is an important
bit of intuition.

1623
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:49,590
So when we say this
is the energy zero,

1624
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:55,277
and the potential has
a minimum at minus v0,

1625
01:04:55,277 --> 01:04:57,360
and we're measuring the
energies relative to zero,

1626
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,080
then the states at the
top of the potential well

1627
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,100
are the states with
energy close to zero.

1628
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,975
And the states at the
bottom of the potential

1629
01:05:03,975 --> 01:05:07,550
well are those states with
the energy of order v0.

1630
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:08,050
cool?

1631
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:12,010
And what are the energies
of all these states?

1632
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:12,920
They're order of v0.

1633
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:13,672
Right?

1634
01:05:13,672 --> 01:05:14,380
Because this is--

1635
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:15,480
Are they exactly v0?

1636
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,080

1637
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,392
No, because this isn't linear.

1638
01:05:19,392 --> 01:05:20,350
It's actually a circle.

1639
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:21,849
So there's going
to be a correction,

1640
01:05:21,849 --> 01:05:23,720
and the correction is
going to be quadratic.

1641
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,636
If you work out that
correction, it's correct.

1642
01:05:25,636 --> 01:05:28,410
The depth above the
bottom of the potential

1643
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:31,720
is correct for the energy of
the corresponding infinite well

1644
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,966
problem.

1645
01:05:32,966 --> 01:05:35,920
I'll leave that to
you as an exercise.

1646
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,800
Other questions?

1647
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,210
OK.

1648
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:41,050
So there's another
limit of this system

1649
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:43,010
that's fun to think about.

1650
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,510
So this was the
infinite well limit.

1651
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:47,110

1652
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,999
What I want to do is I
want to take advantage

1653
01:05:49,999 --> 01:05:52,290
of the observation we made
a second ago that as we make

1654
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:54,680
the well deeper,
we get more states.

1655
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:58,720
As we make the well more
narrow, we get fewer states.

1656
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:05,300
To trade that off, consider
the following limit.

1657
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:14,829
I want to take a potential
well, which has a ground state.

1658
01:06:14,829 --> 01:06:16,370
What does the ground
state look like?

1659
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:18,453
So the ground state wave
function is going to be--

1660
01:06:18,453 --> 01:06:19,940
So here's zero.

1661
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:22,385
And here's
exponentially growing.

1662
01:06:22,385 --> 01:06:23,800
Here's exponentially decreasing.

1663
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,425
And if it's a ground state, how
many nodes will it have inside?

1664
01:06:26,425 --> 01:06:28,010

1665
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:29,760
How many nodes will
the ground state have?

1666
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,634
AUDIENCE: Zero.

1667
01:06:30,634 --> 01:06:31,300
PROFESSOR: Zero.

1668
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:31,820
Good.

1669
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:34,017
OK.

1670
01:06:34,017 --> 01:06:36,100
So the ground state will
look something like this.

1671
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:39,340
We more conventionally
draw it like this.

1672
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:42,870
But just for fun, I'm going
to draw it in this fashion.

1673
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:45,330
In particular, it
has some slope here.

1674
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:46,700
And it has some slope here.

1675
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,280
Oh, shoot.

1676
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,800
Did I?

1677
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,028
Yes, I did.

1678
01:06:50,028 --> 01:06:51,780
Dammit.

1679
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:55,430
I just erased the one thing
that I wanted to hold onto.

1680
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:55,930
OK.

1681
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:57,164
So there's my wave function.

1682
01:06:57,164 --> 01:06:58,580
It has some
particular slope here.

1683
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:00,029
It has some
particular slope here.

1684
01:07:00,029 --> 01:07:01,820
And this is the ground
state wave function,

1685
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:02,609
with some energy.

1686
01:07:02,609 --> 01:07:03,150
I don't know.

1687
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:03,920
I'll call it this.

1688
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,565

1689
01:07:08,565 --> 01:07:10,190
Now, what I want to
do is we've already

1690
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:14,130
shown that as we make the well
more and more shallow and more

1691
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:17,849
and more narrow, the
energy of the ground state

1692
01:07:17,849 --> 01:07:19,140
gets closer and closer to zero.

1693
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:20,870
But there remains
always a bound state.

1694
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,580
There is always at
least one bound state.

1695
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,230
We proved that.

1696
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:27,776
Proved, as a physicist would.

1697
01:07:27,776 --> 01:07:28,650
So I want to do that.

1698
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:29,500
I want to take this seriously.

1699
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,166
But here's the limit
I want to consider.

1700
01:07:31,166 --> 01:07:34,070
Consider the limit that we
make the potential v goes

1701
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:38,920
to infinity, v0, while
making l go to zero.

1702
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,010
So what I want to do is I
want to take this thing,

1703
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:44,464
and I want to make it
deeper and deeper, but more

1704
01:07:44,464 --> 01:07:45,130
and more narrow.

1705
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:52,320

1706
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:56,090
If I do this
repeatedly, eventually I

1707
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:58,860
will get a delta function.

1708
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:00,360
And I will get a
delta function if I

1709
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,820
hold the area of this guy fixed.

1710
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:03,320
Yeah?

1711
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:11,050
So if I do so, holding the
area under this plot fixed,

1712
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:13,876
I will get a delta function.

1713
01:08:13,876 --> 01:08:14,900
Everyone cool with that?

1714
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,347

1715
01:08:18,347 --> 01:08:20,180
So let's think, though,
quickly about what's

1716
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,263
going to happen to the
ground state wave function.

1717
01:08:22,263 --> 01:08:27,240

1718
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:31,319
So as I make the potential,
let's take this wave function,

1719
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:34,979
and let's look at this
version of the potential.

1720
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:36,520
So as I make the
potential deeper,

1721
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,850
what happens to the rate
of the oscillation inside

1722
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:39,974
or to the curvature inside?

1723
01:08:39,974 --> 01:08:43,290

1724
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:44,000
It increases.

1725
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:44,665
Right?

1726
01:08:44,665 --> 01:08:48,450
So the system is oscillating
more, it changes more rapidly,

1727
01:08:48,450 --> 01:08:51,060
because phi double
dot or phi double

1728
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,655
prime is equal to v minus e phi.

1729
01:08:53,655 --> 01:08:54,779
It oscillates more rapidly.

1730
01:08:54,779 --> 01:08:56,749
So to make it deeper,
the system tends

1731
01:08:56,749 --> 01:08:57,939
to oscillate more rapidly.

1732
01:08:57,939 --> 01:09:00,720

1733
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,290
However, as we make
it more narrow,

1734
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:08,389
the system doesn't have
as far to oscillate.

1735
01:09:08,389 --> 01:09:09,930
So it oscillates
more rapidly, but it

1736
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:11,939
doesn't oscillate as far.

1737
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,284
So what's going to happen?

1738
01:09:13,284 --> 01:09:16,410
Well, as we make it more
and more narrow and deeper

1739
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:21,450
and deeper, we again have
the wave function coming in.

1740
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:24,960
And now it oscillates
very rapidly.

1741
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,696
Let's do it again.

1742
01:09:26,696 --> 01:09:31,630
The wave function comes in,
and it oscillates very rapidly.

1743
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:33,609
And the it evanescent tail out.

1744
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:39,450
And now as we have a delta
function, exponential damping,

1745
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:42,750
it oscillates extremely rapidly
over an arbitrarily short

1746
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:46,500
distance and gives
us the kink that we

1747
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,500
knew at the very beginning
we should expect when

1748
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,432
the potential is
a delta function.

1749
01:09:50,432 --> 01:09:51,770
Right?

1750
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:54,069
From our qualitative
structure of the wave function

1751
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:55,330
at the very beginning
we saw that when

1752
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:56,788
we have a delta
function potential,

1753
01:09:56,788 --> 01:09:59,620
we should see a kink
in the wave function.

1754
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:03,780
Because again, if we have phi
prime prime is delta function

1755
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:06,220
discontinuous, phi prime
is the integral of this.

1756
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:08,805
This is a step, and
phi is continuous.

1757
01:10:08,805 --> 01:10:13,330

1758
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:14,970
And so here we have
a step function.

1759
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:18,360
We get a discontinuity
in the second derivative.

1760
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,340
Here we have a delta
function in the potential,

1761
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,440
and we get a discontinuity
in the first derivative

1762
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:26,160
if we get a kink in
the wave function.

1763
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,914
Yeah?

1764
01:10:27,914 --> 01:10:30,192
AUDIENCE: Would we
get a jump there?

1765
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:30,900
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

1766
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:31,910
Say again.

1767
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:32,631
For e1?

1768
01:10:32,631 --> 01:10:33,256
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1769
01:10:33,256 --> 01:10:34,460
Would we get a jump?

1770
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:36,036
PROFESSOR: Very good question.

1771
01:10:36,036 --> 01:10:37,410
So let me do this
more seriously.

1772
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:39,990
Let's do this more carefully.

1773
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:42,130
So the question is, for
the first excited state,

1774
01:10:42,130 --> 01:10:43,727
do we get a jump?

1775
01:10:43,727 --> 01:10:44,810
Do we get a discontinuity?

1776
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:46,680
What do we get for the
first excited state?

1777
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:47,225
Right?

1778
01:10:47,225 --> 01:10:48,750
So let's talk about
that in detail.

1779
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:50,040
It's a very good question.

1780
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:56,132
Example v is equal to
minus v0 delta of x.

1781
01:10:56,132 --> 01:10:58,090
Now, here I want to just
warn you of something.

1782
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:00,670
This is totally standard
notation for these problems,

1783
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:02,950
but you should be
careful about dimensions.

1784
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:06,020
What are the dimensions of
v0, the parameter of v0?

1785
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:09,070

1786
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:10,650
It's tempting to say energy.

1787
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:11,377
That's an energy.

1788
01:11:11,377 --> 01:11:12,085
That's an energy.

1789
01:11:12,085 --> 01:11:12,890
But wait.

1790
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:14,823
What are the dimensions
of the delta function?

1791
01:11:14,823 --> 01:11:15,610
AUDIENCE: Length.

1792
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:16,985
PROFESSOR: Whatever
length right?

1793
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:20,190
Because we know that
delta of alpha x

1794
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:23,500
is equal to 1 over
norm alpha delta of x.

1795
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:27,290

1796
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:29,047
So if I write delta
of x, which is always

1797
01:11:29,047 --> 01:11:31,380
a slightly ballsy thing to
do because this should really

1798
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:33,421
be dimensionless, but if
I write delta of x, then

1799
01:11:33,421 --> 01:11:35,470
this has units of 1
over length, which

1800
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:39,270
means this must have units
of length times energy.

1801
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:42,081

1802
01:11:42,081 --> 01:11:42,580
OK.

1803
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:44,700
Just a little warning,
when you check your answers

1804
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,030
on a problem, you
always want to make sure

1805
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:47,820
that they're
dimensionally consistent.

1806
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,486
And so it will be
important to make sure

1807
01:11:49,486 --> 01:11:52,810
that you use the
energy times the length

1808
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:55,330
for the dimensions
of that beast.

1809
01:11:55,330 --> 01:11:57,910
So my question here is,
is there a bound state?

1810
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:59,580
So for this example,
for this potential,

1811
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:02,610
the delta function
potential bound state, which

1812
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:09,890
again is this guy, is
there a bound state?

1813
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:12,460

1814
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:16,310
So again, we just ran
through the intuition

1815
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:19,410
where we made the potential
deep and deeper and deeper,

1816
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:26,860
v0 divided by epsilon
over width epsilon.

1817
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:33,710
So v0, in order for
this to be an energy

1818
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:35,689
has to be an energy
times a length

1819
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:37,480
because we're going to
divide it by length.

1820
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,313
So this is going to
give us a delta function

1821
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:40,290
potential in the limit.

1822
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:41,748
We have an intuition
that we should

1823
01:12:41,748 --> 01:12:43,209
get a bound state with a kink.

1824
01:12:43,209 --> 01:12:44,500
But let's check that intuition.

1825
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,300
We want to actually
solve this problem.

1826
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,170
So we'll do the same
thing we did before.

1827
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:55,390
We now write the general
solution in the places

1828
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:58,610
where the potential is
constant, which is on the left

1829
01:12:58,610 --> 01:12:59,920
and on the right.

1830
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,460
And then we want to impose
appropriate boundary conditions

1831
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:05,562
at the interface and at
infinity, where these are going

1832
01:13:05,562 --> 01:13:08,020
to be normalizable, and this
is whatever the right boundary

1833
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:08,590
conditions are.

1834
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:10,050
So we are going to have to
derive the appropriate boundary

1835
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:10,700
conditions.

1836
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,020
So let's just do that quickly.

1837
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:17,710
So phi with definite
e is equal to a--

1838
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:20,020
So in this region
in the left, it's

1839
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:22,270
either growing or
decreasing exponential.

1840
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:27,010
So ae to the alpha x plus
be to the minus alpha x.

1841
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:29,370
And this is x less than 0.

1842
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:34,130
And ce to the alpha x
plus de to the minus

1843
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:36,970
alpha x for x greater than 0.

1844
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:39,047
So first off, let's
hit normalizability.

1845
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:40,630
What must be true
for normalizability?

1846
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:43,255

1847
01:13:43,255 --> 01:13:45,740
Yeah, they'd better be
converging to zero here

1848
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:48,840
and converging to zero here,
which means that c had better

1849
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,381
vanish and b had better vanish.

1850
01:13:52,381 --> 01:13:52,880
OK.

1851
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,260
So those guys are gone
from normalizability.

1852
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:59,170
And meanwhile, if
this is symmetric,

1853
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:01,790
what is going to be true
of the ground state?

1854
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:03,090
It's going to be symmetric.

1855
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:07,214
So a must be equal to d.

1856
01:14:07,214 --> 01:14:08,490
Great.

1857
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:12,220
So a is now just some overall
normalization constant,

1858
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,720
which we can fix
from normalization.

1859
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,595
So it looks like this
should be the solution.

1860
01:14:15,595 --> 01:14:17,060
We have an exponential.

1861
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:18,420
We have an exponential.

1862
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:23,080
But there's one more
boundary condition to fix.

1863
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,440
We have to satisfy
some matching.

1864
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,190
We have to satisfy the
boundary conditions

1865
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:28,106
at the delta function.

1866
01:14:28,106 --> 01:14:30,310
So what are those?

1867
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:32,770
What are those
matching conditions?

1868
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:36,820
So we can get that from the
energy eigenvalue equation,

1869
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:39,850
which says that
phi prime prime is

1870
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,851
equal to h bar squared upon 2m.

1871
01:14:41,851 --> 01:14:42,350
Sorry.

1872
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:45,027

1873
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:46,110
Get your dimensions right.

1874
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:49,680
So it's 2m over h bar
squared v minus e.

1875
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:54,470
In this case, v is equal
to minus v0 delta function.

1876
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:58,690

1877
01:14:58,690 --> 01:14:59,910
That's very strange.

1878
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:05,392
So minus 2m over h bar squared
v0 delta of x minus e--

1879
01:15:05,392 --> 01:15:06,350
I pulled out the minus.

1880
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:09,360
--so plus e phi.

1881
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,090

1882
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,860
So this must be
true at every point.

1883
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,318
This of course, is
zero everywhere,

1884
01:15:15,318 --> 01:15:20,460
except for at the origin.

1885
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:22,420
So what we want to do
is we want to turn this

1886
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:24,029
into a boundary condition.

1887
01:15:24,029 --> 01:15:25,820
And we know what the
boundary condition is.

1888
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:28,604
If v is a delta function, that
means that phi prime prime

1889
01:15:28,604 --> 01:15:30,270
is also a delta
function or proportional

1890
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:31,390
to a delta function.

1891
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:33,350
That means that phi
prime is a step function.

1892
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:34,308
And how did I get that?

1893
01:15:34,308 --> 01:15:36,622
I got that by integrating
phi prime prime.

1894
01:15:36,622 --> 01:15:38,955
You integrate a delta function,
you get a step function.

1895
01:15:38,955 --> 01:15:39,960
Well, that's cool.

1896
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,700
How do we figure out what
step function discontinuity

1897
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:43,750
gives us?

1898
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:44,530
Let's integrate.

1899
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:46,488
Let's integrate right
across the delta function

1900
01:15:46,488 --> 01:15:48,730
and figure out what
the discontinuity is.

1901
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:50,880
So let's take this
equation, integrate it

1902
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,649
from minus epsilon
to epsilon, where

1903
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:53,940
epsilon is a very small number.

1904
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:56,780

1905
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:58,150
And that's epsilon to epsilon.

1906
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:00,025
So what is this going
to give us on the left?

1907
01:16:00,025 --> 01:16:01,570
Well, integral of
a total derivative

1908
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:04,680
is just the value of the
thing at a value to the point.

1909
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:09,040
So this is going to be
phi prime at epsilon

1910
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,620
minus phi prime
and minus epsilon.

1911
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:12,460
What does that mean?

1912
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:15,230
The difference
between the derivative

1913
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:17,440
just after the origin and
just before the origin.

1914
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,350
This is the discontinuity
for very small epsilon.

1915
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:22,220
This is the discontinuity
of the derivative

1916
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,720
at the origin at
the delta function.

1917
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:26,053
And we already expected it
to have a step discontinuity.

1918
01:16:26,053 --> 01:16:26,980
And there it is.

1919
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,242
And how big is it?

1920
01:16:28,242 --> 01:16:29,700
Well on the right
hand side we have

1921
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:32,475
2m minus 2m upon h bar squared.

1922
01:16:32,475 --> 01:16:33,850
And we're going
to get two terms.

1923
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:36,050
We get a term from
integrating the first term.

1924
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:39,700
But over this narrow
window, around,

1925
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,130
let's say epsilon was here, over
this narrow window we can treat

1926
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:47,160
the wave function as being
more or less constant.

1927
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:51,042
But in any case,
it's continuous.

1928
01:16:51,042 --> 01:16:52,250
And this is a delta function.

1929
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,874
So we know what we get from the
integral of the delta function.

1930
01:16:54,874 --> 01:16:58,870
We just get the value v0
phi at the delta function.

1931
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:01,660
Phi of the zero at the
delta functions, so phi 0.

1932
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:05,230
We get a second term, which
is plus the energy integrated

1933
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:06,491
against phi.

1934
01:17:06,491 --> 01:17:07,490
The energy's a constant.

1935
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:09,150
And phi is continuous.

1936
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:11,350
So this, whatever else
you can say about it,

1937
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:12,995
is roughly the
constant value of phi

1938
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:15,220
at the origin times the
energy times the width, which

1939
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:17,070
is epsilon.

1940
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:20,466
So plus-order epsilon terms.

1941
01:17:20,466 --> 01:17:21,984
Everyone cool with that?

1942
01:17:21,984 --> 01:17:23,400
So now what I'm
going to do is I'm

1943
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,399
going to take the limit
as epsilon goes to zero.

1944
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:28,830

1945
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:31,540
So I'm just going to take
that the discontinuity just

1946
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:32,040
across zero.

1947
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:37,590
So this is going to give
me, of this gives me

1948
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:41,240
the change in the
slope at the origin.

1949
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,090
OK.

1950
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,590
The derivative just
after the origin

1951
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:46,170
minus the derivative just
before the origin is equal to--

1952
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:48,490
These order epsilon
terms go away.

1953
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:54,800
--minus 2m upon h
bar squared v0 phi.

1954
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:59,060
So that's my continuity.

1955
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:00,680
That's the condition
for continuity

1956
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:03,410
of the derivative and
appropriate discontinuity

1957
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:07,540
of the first derivative
at the origin.

1958
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:10,510
And so this, when we
plug-in these values

1959
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:12,390
of this form for
the wave function,

1960
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:14,390
when we take a derivative,
all we're going to do

1961
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:16,919
is we're going to
pick up an alpha.

1962
01:18:16,919 --> 01:18:18,460
And so when we work
all of this out--

1963
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,879
I'm not going to go
through the algebra.

1964
01:18:20,879 --> 01:18:22,920
You're going to go through
it on the problem set.

1965
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,450
--when we take this condition,
when we impose this condition

1966
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,270
with this wave
function, it gives us

1967
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:28,870
a very specific value for alpha.

1968
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:33,560
This is only solvable
if alpha is equal to mv0

1969
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,640
upon h bar squared.

1970
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,840

1971
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:39,830
Good.

1972
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:41,310
So let's just check the units.

1973
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:44,870
So this is momentum times
length, momentum times length.

1974
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:46,600
This is mass.

1975
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,940
This is an energy
times a length.

1976
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:52,770
So this has overall units
of, p squared over m,

1977
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:55,300
overall units of 1 upon
length, which is what we wan.

1978
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:56,900
So that's good.

1979
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,030
So we get alpha is
equal to mv0 upon h bar.

1980
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:00,890
And that gives us the
form of the potential.

1981
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:03,640
And it also tells us that the
energy, plugging this back in,

1982
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:08,530
is equal to minus h bar
squared alpha squared upon 2m,

1983
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:10,770
which we could then
plug-in the value of alpha

1984
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:12,110
and solve for v0.

1985
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:15,487
So what we found is that
there is a single bound state

1986
01:19:15,487 --> 01:19:17,070
of the delta function
potential, which

1987
01:19:17,070 --> 01:19:19,028
we could have gotten by
just taking this limit.

1988
01:19:19,028 --> 01:19:20,960
It's a fun way to
rederive the same result.

1989
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,740
It's a nice check on
your understanding.

1990
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:25,370
So we find that there's
a single bound state

1991
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:27,110
of the delta function potential.

1992
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:29,980
Now, what about an
odd bound state?

1993
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:32,180
We assumed at an important
point that this was even.

1994
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:35,610
What if I assume
that it was odd?

1995
01:19:35,610 --> 01:19:38,120
One node, what if we had
assumed that it was odd?

1996
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,020
What would be true
of the wave function?

1997
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,860
Well for odd, this would be
a, and this would be minus a.

1998
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:46,100
So the value of the wave
function at the origin is what?

1999
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:46,700
Zero.

2000
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,430
So that tells us the value
of the wave function is zero.

2001
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:51,780
What's the discontinuity?

2002
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:52,340
Zero.

2003
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:54,760
So it's as if
there's no potential

2004
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:57,480
because it has a zero right
at the delta function.

2005
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,430
Yeah?

2006
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:03,160
But that means that this wave
function, an odd wave function,

2007
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,980
doesn't notice the delta
function potential.

2008
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:09,430
So is there a bound state?

2009
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:11,100
No.

2010
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:13,630
So how many bound
states are there?

2011
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:17,180
Always exactly one for the
single isolated delta function.

2012
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:18,560
On your problem
set, you're going

2013
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,390
to use the result of the
single isolated delta function,

2014
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:24,520
and more broadly you're
going to derive the results

2015
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,050
for two delta functions.

2016
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:28,310
So you might say, why
two delta functions?

2017
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:30,470
And the answer is,
the two delta function

2018
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:33,080
problem, which
involves no math--

2019
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:33,580
Right?

2020
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,670
It's a totally straightforward,
simple problem.

2021
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:38,400
You can all do it right
now on a piece of paper.

2022
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,780
The two delta
function problem is

2023
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:42,370
going to turn out to
be an awesome model

2024
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:44,515
for the binding of atoms.

2025
01:20:44,515 --> 01:20:47,810
And we're going to use it as
intuition on your problem set

2026
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:50,890
to explain how quantum
mechanical effects can lead

2027
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:54,390
to an attractive force
between two atoms.

2028
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:55,760
See you next time.

2029
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,310
[APPLAUSE]

2030
01:20:57,310 --> 01:21:04,463
