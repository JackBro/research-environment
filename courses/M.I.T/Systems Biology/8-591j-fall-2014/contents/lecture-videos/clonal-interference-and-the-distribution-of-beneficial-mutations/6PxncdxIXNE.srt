10
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:26,760
PROFESSOR: I.e.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,090
When multiple lineages
of beneficial mutants

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,790
are kind of spreading in a
population at the same time,

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,660
so when these clones
are somehow interfering

14
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,550
with each other
in the population,

15
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,110
how is it that that
clonal interference effect

16
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,035
kind of plays out in the context
of these microbial asexual

17
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:42,535
populations.

18
00:00:42,535 --> 00:00:45,720
And in particular,
in this paper, what

19
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,700
they were trying to measure
was the distribution of effects

20
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,390
of beneficial mutations.

21
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,650
So you've put a population
into some new environment.

22
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,540
There may be some beneficial
mutations that are possible.

23
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,270
The question is, what is
the probability distribution

24
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,732
of effects of those
beneficial mutations.

25
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:04,000
And this is, as
you might imagine,

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,460
a very basic quantitative
we'd like to understand just

27
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,574
to understand how evolution
works in new environments.

28
00:01:10,574 --> 00:01:11,990
But it's actually
something that's

29
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,156
rather difficult to measure.

30
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,130
And what's interesting
here is it's

31
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:20,960
difficult to measure for
maybe a surprising reason.

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,160
This is a wonderful example
of how you kind of-- if life

33
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,370
gives you lemons,
then make lemonade.

34
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,066
Is that the expression?

35
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:30,953
OK.

36
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:31,452
All right.

37
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:34,090
So in this paper, they
set out to try and measure

38
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,450
the [? distribution ?] effects
of beneficial mutations.

39
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,227
They were unsuccessful.

40
00:01:39,227 --> 00:01:41,435
But they were unsuccessful
for an interesting reason,

41
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,336
so then they were able
to write what I think

42
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:47,304
is a very nice science paper.

43
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:50,215
Are there any
questions about where

44
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:52,590
we are or administrative
things before we get going?

45
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,340

46
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,610
All right, so just to recap
where we were from last time,

47
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,990
we introduced this
Moran model, which

48
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,650
there's a fixed
population size, N.

49
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,650
Then each of these sort
of cycles, what we do

50
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,210
is we choose one
individual to divide

51
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,725
and we choose one
individual to be replaced.

52
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:23,830
And we have the daughter, say,
cell replace the cell that

53
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,150
was chosen for replacement.

54
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,690
Now in that model,
what we found was

55
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,560
that there's some
probability, x1,

56
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,500
for a new mutant with
relative fitness,

57
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,040
r, to actually fix
in the population.

58
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,850
And this is in the case
of no clonal interference.

59
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,740
So CI will in general be
clonal interference today.

60
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,170
So this is-- if it's
just this one mutation

61
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,590
that we're considering, then
the question of surviving

62
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,750
stochastic extinction
kind of at the beginning

63
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,190
is equivalent to the
question of being

64
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,610
able to fix in the
population certainly

65
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,490
for a beneficial mutation,
with r greater than 1.

66
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,360
So what we want to do
today to just start

67
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,890
is to try to think
about how we can

68
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,980
use this model and
this equation in order

69
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,578
to understand the
probability of fixation

70
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:19,744
when there's more than one
mutant in the population.

71
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:22,780

72
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,080
So here, what we found
is that this thing,

73
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,730
there are 2 limits that we
might want to keep track of.

74
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:41,020
So this thing goes to 1 over
n, for neutral mutations,

75
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:47,470
and it goes to S for moderately
beneficial mutations.

76
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,300

77
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:57,140
So S is defined as r minus 1.

78
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,990
So it's this for
S kind of greater

79
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:04,145
than zero, and for S times
n, much larger than 1.

80
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:11,210

81
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,756
So I guess this already says
that S is greater than zero,

82
00:04:13,756 --> 00:04:14,755
so we could ignore that.

83
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,380

84
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,779
Are there any questions
about this before we

85
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:26,075
get going to practice using it?

86
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:29,440
All right, so I just
wanted to have us consider

87
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,365
a few possible situations.

88
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:35,138

89
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:37,480
All right, population size 10.

90
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,290
What we want to consider
a situation where

91
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,550
there are two mutants.

92
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,414

93
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:49,760
And we're going to call them A
and B, with relative fitness rA

94
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,315
1.01, and rB 0.99.

95
00:04:55,315 --> 00:05:00,030
So A is a beneficial mutant,
and B is a deleterious mutant.

96
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,640
And in all these
problems, we're going

97
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,740
to assume that the rest of
the population has fitness 1.

98
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,114
So these fitnesses
of A and B, they

99
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:10,030
are as compared to the
rest of the population.

100
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,680
So in this case, there are
eight other individuals

101
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,765
with relative fitness 1.

102
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:15,490

103
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,340
So the question is, what is
the probability that a fixes.

104
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:26,450

105
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,950
Takes over the population.

106
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,120
Reaches number of A
individuals equal to 10.

107
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,800
At that stage, we're not
allowing for any new mutations

108
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,765
here, so then that's
the end of the dynamics.

109
00:05:36,765 --> 00:05:40,212

110
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:41,670
So you can start
thinking about it,

111
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,980
and I will give
some options here.

112
00:05:43,980 --> 00:06:08,310

113
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,619
All right so this is
in the Moran model,

114
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:12,160
what is the probability
that A fixes.

115
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,620

116
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,028
I'll give you 20 seconds
to think about it.

117
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:43,950

118
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,460
Do you need more time?

119
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,314

120
00:06:51,314 --> 00:06:53,230
Let's go ahead and vote,
and see where we are.

121
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:53,840
Ready.

122
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,165
Three, two, one--

123
00:06:56,165 --> 00:07:01,070

124
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:06,100
All right, we got some-- I'd
say Bs, Cs is kind of dominant.

125
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,900
All right.

126
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,150
So I'd say that there's
generally a disagreement

127
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,852
between B and C. Interesting.

128
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,320
OK.

129
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,520
I think that there's--
it's almost 50/50.

130
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,700
It is a bit splotchy, somehow.

131
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,135
You may need to make some effort
to find somebody that disagrees

132
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:25,260
with you, but please do so.

133
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,510
All right, turn to a neighbor
and try to convince them

134
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,716
that you're right.

135
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:34,684
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

136
00:07:34,684 --> 00:08:36,218

137
00:08:36,218 --> 00:08:39,194
PROFESSOR: All right, let's
go ahead and reconvene and see

138
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:42,250
if anybody [INAUDIBLE].

139
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,200
Ready.

140
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,692
Three, two, one.

141
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:49,580
All right.

142
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,660
I'd say that there's
some migration towards C,

143
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,170
but it's not all the way.

144
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,320
All right, different arguments.

145
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,024
And you may want to-- D is the
argument to be made over here.

146
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:04,190
All right, so let's hear it.

147
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

148
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,618
So if there's one
individual from A

149
00:09:06,618 --> 00:09:09,764
and one individual from
B, and basically they're

150
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:12,250
about the same fitness,
then the probability

151
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,729
that they should, I
guess, take over is 50%.

152
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:18,214
Well that assumes that one
of them will take over.

153
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:18,936
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
is there any reason

154
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:20,769
to assume that one of
them should take over?

155
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,687
AUDIENCE: No.

156
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,120
PROFESSOR: I think that we
may agree that the probability

157
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,105
that A fixes is going
to be approximately

158
00:09:27,105 --> 00:09:29,249
equal to the probability
that B fixes.

159
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:30,748
That's going to be
a useful insight.

160
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:32,740
But [INAUDIBLE]
both those things.

161
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,732
So we have to keep
track of that.

162
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:38,995
So that's the argument
for why it's not D.

163
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,210
AUDIENCE: You're welcome.

164
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,420
PROFESSOR: Anytime. [INAUDIBLE].

165
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,590
So between B and C, how
can we think about this?

166
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,415

167
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:51,540
You can tell us once again
what your neighbor said.

168
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,040
That's fine.

169
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,726
AUDIENCE: Why?

170
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:53,350
PROFESSOR: Yes.

171
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,495
AUDIENCE: Um, well, my
neighbor, as opposed to me,

172
00:09:57,495 --> 00:10:01,068
made the correct decision to try
to think about it intuitively

173
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,984
instead of trying to get
through all the math.

174
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:03,764
PROFESSOR: Yes.

175
00:10:03,764 --> 00:10:05,930
Always good to think about
things intuitively rather

176
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,090
than-- that's--

177
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

178
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,210
So A is very
slightly beneficial,

179
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,910
and so it is just
a little bit more

180
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,392
likely to fix than
a neutral mutation.

181
00:10:17,392 --> 00:10:21,110
PROFESSOR: OK, and how can
we quantify this statement?

182
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,486
That I know I said that I
didn't like math, but you know,

183
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:25,151
every now and then
we should look at it.

184
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,380
Yeah, so this statement
that A is approximately

185
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,130
a neutral mutation.

186
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,878
How is it that we can--
how do we know that?

187
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:32,832
I mean did--

188
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,217
AUDIENCE: We have criteria
for nearly neutral.

189
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,580
PROFESSOR: Yes, we have a
criteria for nearly neutral.

190
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,913
What does that-- what does
it mean to be nearly neutral?

191
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:42,632
AUDIENCE: The
magnitude of S times N

192
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:44,361
is much, much less than one.

193
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:45,360
PROFESSOR: That's right.

194
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,360
S times N is much
less than one, which

195
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,690
means that it's nearly neutral.

196
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,180
What that means is that
the probability of fixing

197
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,610
is the same as if it
were a neutral mutation,

198
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,218
or approximately the same.

199
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:01,548
And is that the case here?

200
00:11:01,548 --> 00:11:02,480
AUDIENCE: Yes.

201
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,412
PROFESSOR: Yes.

202
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,460
S is 0.01, so 1/100.

203
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,780
N is 10.

204
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,660
So S times N is equal to 0.1.

205
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,212
Which means that both-- so
A is maybe nearly neutral.

206
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:16,045
Is B nearly neutral?

207
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:16,740
AUDIENCE: Yes.

208
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,430
PROFESSOR: Yes, so both A
and B are nearly neutral.

209
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,110
One of them is an advantageous
mutant, one is a deleterious.

210
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,390
But in this
population size, they

211
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,420
both behave as if
they're nearly neutral.

212
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,110
But in a larger
population, so if

213
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,245
we had a million
individuals, would these

214
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:31,119
be neutral mutations?

215
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:31,706
AUDIENCE: No.

216
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:33,840
PROFESSOR: No.

217
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,110
So the question of
whether something behaves

218
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,021
as a neutral mutation depends
upon the population size

219
00:11:39,021 --> 00:11:40,360
via this relation.

220
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,430

221
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,345
So that's-- and then
how do we go from there?

222
00:11:47,345 --> 00:11:52,676
AUDIENCE: Well the probability
of a neutral mutation

223
00:11:52,676 --> 00:11:54,946
[INAUDIBLE] population
is going to be [? 1/S ?].

224
00:11:54,946 --> 00:11:55,946
PROFESSOR: That's right.

225
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:58,786
A neutral mutation will fix
a probability of one group.

226
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:02,540
So indeed, we're
going to get this.

227
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,950
And we need to
highlight that we can--

228
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,510
you have to be very careful
about just sticking things

229
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,530
into formulas.

230
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,460
So you may remember
that the probability

231
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:17,050
of a beneficial mutant fixing
in the population is S.

232
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,750
But that's only for S times
N being much larger than one,

233
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,700
and that's when there's
no clonal interference.

234
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,200
When you don't have to compete
with other beneficial mutants

235
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,810
in the lineage.

236
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,963
We're going to see an
example of this in a moment.

237
00:12:28,963 --> 00:12:30,463
But if you just
have a single mutant

238
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:34,900
in the population, that's
beneficial in the sense of it's

239
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,390
not neutral.

240
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,740
Then probably the fixation is S.

241
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,420
And of course, this
is nonsensical, right?

242
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,790
Because you can't--
it wouldn't make any--

243
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,990
certainly it wouldn't--
given that you say oh well,

244
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,448
if it were neutral, it would
fix with a probability of 10%.

245
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:50,920
And then you say oh, but if
it's an advantageous mutant,

246
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,776
it can't fix with a
probability less than that.

247
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:58,142
So this is nearly neutral,
fixation probability is 10%.

248
00:12:58,142 --> 00:12:59,975
Are there any questions
about that argument?

249
00:12:59,975 --> 00:13:04,725

250
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:09,141
So let's consider a
different problem.

251
00:13:09,141 --> 00:13:12,943
So now, we're going to consider
a population that's larger.

252
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:14,949
So it's going to be the
same situation, where

253
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:19,928
we have these two mutants
present as single individuals.

254
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:28,401

255
00:13:28,401 --> 00:13:30,900
So what we want to know now is
the probability that B fixes.

256
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:37,261

257
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:39,260
Once again, you should
start thinking about this

258
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,590
while I type it.

259
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,200
Oh, there was one
other thing I wanted

260
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,980
to say, actually, over here.

261
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,410
If we modeled these
population dynamics

262
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:57,240
using differential equations--
so instead of doing the Moran

263
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,692
process where we stochastic
dynamics of division,

264
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:03,150
replacement, and so forth, if
you write down a differential

265
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:07,720
equation describing
this situation,

266
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,277
what is the probability
that A fixes?

267
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:10,735
I'm going to give
you five seconds.

268
00:14:10,735 --> 00:14:11,556
AUDIENCE: One.

269
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:14,532
PROFESSOR: All right, one.

270
00:14:14,532 --> 00:14:16,516
OK, so you don't get to vote.

271
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:20,062
Indeed, 1.

272
00:14:20,062 --> 00:14:22,270
So if you had written down
the differential equation,

273
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,360
then there's no
randomness there.

274
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,480
Whichever mutant has
the largest fitness

275
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,535
will fix with probability 1.

276
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:32,035
OK?

277
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:35,602

278
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:36,810
OK, probability that B fixes.

279
00:14:36,810 --> 00:15:09,470

280
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,260
So this-- you show
me both [INAUDIBLE].

281
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,870

282
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,541
I'll give you 20, 30
seconds to think about this.

283
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:27,425

284
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:27,925
Yes?

285
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:31,066
AUDIENCE: Is there
just one [INAUDIBLE]?

286
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:32,950
PROFESSOR: Yes.

287
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,250
All right, so this kind
of-- that's why-- yeah.

288
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,416
So it's just the same thing.

289
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:42,420
And so that's a single A
mutant and a single B mutant.

290
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:49,298
Single A, single
B. But you should

291
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:52,072
know how to calculate these
things if I tell you that they

292
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:53,030
were some other number.

293
00:15:53,030 --> 00:16:09,214

294
00:16:09,214 --> 00:16:10,130
Do you need more time?

295
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:16,804

296
00:16:16,804 --> 00:16:19,470
So in general, if you don't look
at me when I ask that question,

297
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,840
I'm going to take that as
meaning that you're still

298
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,640
thinking about it.

299
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,196
Is that how I should
interpret that?

300
00:16:23,196 --> 00:16:23,696
OK.

301
00:16:23,696 --> 00:16:48,020

302
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,930
Let's go ahead and vote just so
that we can see where we are.

303
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,270
OK, ready.

304
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,550
Three, two, one.

305
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,486

306
00:16:58,486 --> 00:17:00,500
All right.

307
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,730
We're all over the place.

308
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,569
That's great.

309
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:07,660
Because that means your
neighbor will either

310
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,869
be able to help you or
confuse you, or do something.

311
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:13,266
So let's [INAUDIBLE].

312
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,540
There's a million--
population size 1,000,000.

313
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,849
We have two mutants
in the population.

314
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:20,619
One has relative fitness
2, one has relative fitness

315
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:25,599
of-- an advantage of 1%.

316
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,830
One thing to be careful
of here is the equation

317
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:37,655
that we have for probability
of fixation here-- ah.

318
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:39,530
There's one more thing
that I should say.

319
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,640
It's for S. Well, it's
an S much less than 1.

320
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,380

321
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,390
Just for-- so this is for a
moderately-beneficial mutation.

322
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,931
Otherwise, you have to
use the full approach.

323
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:54,925
Yes?

324
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:56,416
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

325
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,410
PROFESSOR: All right.

326
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,868
Go ahead and turn
to your neighbor,

327
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:02,877
and try to convince them
that you've figured this out.

328
00:18:02,877 --> 00:18:06,853
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

329
00:18:06,853 --> 00:19:32,326

330
00:19:32,326 --> 00:19:35,870
PROFESSOR: So everybody
should be talking to somebody.

331
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,720
What do you think?

332
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,067

333
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:45,550
Well it's OK to not know,
but that's why you--

334
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,920
you should either join them,
or if you look behind you,

335
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:55,610
there's someone else that
looks very, uh-- All right,

336
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,897
why don't-- let's-- OK.

337
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:57,730
Let's-- what's that?

338
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,100
AUDIENCE: I said my reasons
are always good reasons.

339
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,950
PROFESSOR: They're
always good reasons.

340
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,280
They'll be educational.

341
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,560
All right, let's go
ahead and reconvene.

342
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,150
I know that there were a
lot of different guesses

343
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,410
on this problem,
which means maybe

344
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,060
that the conversations were
scattered or difficult,

345
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,680
or it was difficult to converge.

346
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,940
But still, let's see if
it made any difference.

347
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,440
Ready.

348
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,230
Three, two, one.

349
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,064
OK.

350
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:30,730
All right, yeah.

351
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,570
So I'd say that the
conversations have helped.

352
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,330
But we're still a
fair distribution

353
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:43,370
between maybe A, C, and D still.

354
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:43,932
But-- yeah.

355
00:20:43,932 --> 00:20:45,640
Does somebody want to
give an explanation

356
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,592
for one of those three,
or something else?

357
00:20:49,592 --> 00:20:50,300
Yeah, [? John. ?]

358
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],
then you know [INAUDIBLE].

359
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,350

360
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,310
PROFESSOR: Right.

361
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,730
AUDIENCE: And it indicates
that [INAUDIBLE].

362
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,150
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

363
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:00,290
OK.

364
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,956
Now I just want to
make sure that we all

365
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:02,820
agree on this logic.

366
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,590
So if the only thing we
had was the mutation B,

367
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,900
then the probability of
fixation would be 1% because,

368
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,220
in that case-- is this a
nearly neutral mutation?

369
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,490
No.

370
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,570
So that means that its
probability of fixation

371
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,670
is going to be around
S, in this case, 1.01.

372
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,430
OK, but--

373
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,595
AUDIENCE: But now A is
there, so you-- first, you

374
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:27,290
expect that-- you expect
the probability of B

375
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,720
to fix to be lower than 1%.

376
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,150
A fixes in half of the cases.

377
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,170
PROFESSOR: That's right.

378
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,325
AUDIENCE: So in these cases,
[? B's ?] not going to fix.

379
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:38,210
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

380
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,626
AUDIENCE: So my answer is C,
but I mean, it's a bit of a--

381
00:21:40,626 --> 00:21:42,447
PROFESSOR: Yeah, no,
no, I mean it's-- no,

382
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:44,030
but that's precisely
what's happening.

383
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:48,680
So for B to fix, it requires
two things to happen.

384
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,760
First, B has to survive
stochastic extinction.

385
00:21:51,760 --> 00:22:00,130

386
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:05,340
And-- so we're going to
multiply these probabilities--

387
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,130
A doesn't survive.

388
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,170

389
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,320
We're going to discuss in
a moment what this really

390
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,403
means in terms of surviving
stochastic extinction.

391
00:22:15,403 --> 00:22:18,090
But when a new mutation
appears in the population,

392
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,660
it will either relatively
quickly go extinct,

393
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,360
or it will relatively
quickly become established,

394
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,380
is what we call that.

395
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,755
What that means
is that it will--

396
00:22:25,755 --> 00:22:27,180
if it's a beneficial
mutation, it

397
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,560
will take over unless it's
outcompeted by someone else.

398
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,470
So it has to be that B
survives stochastic extinction,

399
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:39,400
and A doesn't survive
this initial phase.

400
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,080
And this thing-- so that
means that the probability

401
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,552
that B fixes is going
to be-- well, OK.

402
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,760
The probability that B
survives stochastic extinction

403
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,004
is going to be 1%.

404
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:56,320
The probability that A survives
is 1/2, so the probability

405
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,820
that it doesn't
survive is also 1/2.

406
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:03,226

407
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:04,850
Now the half, just
to remind ourselves,

408
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,970
comes from this thing x1, for
A. There was this [INAUDIBLE].

409
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:15,190

410
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,728
This thing is what?

411
00:23:18,728 --> 00:23:19,644
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

412
00:23:19,644 --> 00:23:20,560
PROFESSOR: Right.

413
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,540
So this thing very
quickly goes to zero.

414
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,410
So this is 1/2 to
the millionth power.

415
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,860
So that's zero.

416
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,320
So we just get 1 minus 1/2.

417
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:38,500

418
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,000
Yes.

419
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,458
AUDIENCE: But what
are we assuming?

420
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,742
It's not clear to
me in this case.

421
00:23:42,742 --> 00:23:44,950
Because we're assuming
they're completely independent

422
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,825
and we can multiply--

423
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:46,825
PROFESSOR: That's right.

424
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:47,980
AUDIENCE: Together, so--

425
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,370
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

426
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:54,290
And I would say that for--
from the same [INAUDIBLE]

427
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,710
the population of
a million, these

428
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:00,740
are totally non-interacting
processes, for all intents

429
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,410
and purposes.

430
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,460
If you were down to a
population size of 10,

431
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,132
then you might have
to worry that they're

432
00:24:07,132 --> 00:24:08,090
going to interact more.

433
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:13,260
But in this process of--
in this Moran process,

434
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,997
you have a million individuals.

435
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:16,580
It's true that this
is twice as likely

436
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,240
to be chosen to divide
as a normal cell,

437
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,906
but you're talking
about a million cells

438
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:21,500
in that population.

439
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,630
So the correction to the things
that you're worrying about

440
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,970
is a [INAUDIBLE] 10 to the 6.

441
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,802
AUDIENCE: And so the
thing [INAUDIBLE], yeah.

442
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:33,050
But if rA and rB were closer, I
should [INAUDIBLE] correction--

443
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:33,980
PROFESSOR: No.

444
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,450
It's not about how close rA
and rB are to each other.

445
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,510
Even if they had the exact
same relative fitness.

446
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,332
Even if they were
both 2 or both 1.01,

447
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:46,040
then they would still
be non-interacting.

448
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,565
And that's just because they're
in this sea of individuals.

449
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:50,481
AUDIENCE: But the thing
that I'm worried about

450
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:52,510
is, for example, rA
could take over quickly,

451
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,810
and then rB could take over.

452
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:55,650
And that--

453
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,385
PROFESSOR: OK--

454
00:24:56,385 --> 00:24:57,792
AUDIENCE: Would not be--

455
00:24:57,792 --> 00:24:58,500
PROFESSOR: Right.

456
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

457
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,070
PROFESSOR: OK so--

458
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,569
AUDIENCE: And that's
not reasonable.

459
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:03,675
[? If this case ?] is rA
[INAUDIBLE], then rB--

460
00:25:03,675 --> 00:25:05,012
the effective rB--

461
00:25:05,012 --> 00:25:05,720
PROFESSOR: Right.

462
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,120
OK So there is one
problem-- You're right.

463
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,190
So I should be careful.

464
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:11,640
If the two mutants have
exactly the same fitness,

465
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,770
then if they both survive
stochastic extinction,

466
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,410
they're going to-- then
you can describe everything

467
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,480
as a differential.

468
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,310
And this is the distinction
between this initial phase

469
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,940
of trying to become
established as

470
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,710
compared to the later dynamics
in that the established means

471
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,490
that if it's a beneficial
mutation, it will spread,

472
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,440
and basically deterministically.

473
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,530
So in that situation, if you
had two mutants, and both

474
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,809
of relative fitness
1.01, then they both

475
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:37,600
would try to survive
stochastic extinction.

476
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,974
And let's say that
they both did.

477
00:25:38,974 --> 00:25:41,870
Then they would both spread in
the population exponentially.

478
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,610
Of course, given that
the initial dynamics

479
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,144
are stochastic,
then it would still

480
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,060
be the case that one of
them would just happen

481
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,340
to be above the other one.

482
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,230
But then they would grow
exponentially together.

483
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,180
That's a more
complicated situation

484
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,360
than what we're
going to discuss.

485
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,906
And that would
actually be very rare.

486
00:25:57,906 --> 00:25:59,280
Because each one
of these mutants

487
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,988
would only have a 1%
chance of surviving.

488
00:26:00,988 --> 00:26:03,760
So only one in 10 to
the 4 times would you

489
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,417
end up with both
of these mutants

490
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:06,750
surviving stochastic extinction.

491
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,790

492
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:15,720
Any other questions about-- so
I just want to be clear here.

493
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,336
So this is when A is equal to
1-- the number of A individuals

494
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:21,210
is 1, the number of B
individuals equal to 1.

495
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:28,420

496
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:35,890
There was a question, what if
we started with A equal to 10.

497
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,830
So let's say the-- yeah.

498
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,330
let's?

499
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:44,190
Say we start with 10A
and 10B, for example.

500
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,415
So instead of starting with just
mutant A and one mutant B, now

501
00:26:47,415 --> 00:26:49,630
we have 10 of each.

502
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:53,140
So we're changing
things symmetrically.

503
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,660
What's going to be the
probability that B fixes,

504
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,479
approximately?

505
00:26:58,479 --> 00:27:00,270
This is going to be a
little funny somehow.

506
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,850
But OK, we'll-- just think
about it for 15 seconds.

507
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:09,760
What's going to the probability
that B fixes in this case?

508
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:32,624

509
00:27:32,624 --> 00:27:35,205
All right, I'm worried you
guys are now even trying.

510
00:27:35,205 --> 00:27:38,964

511
00:27:38,964 --> 00:27:40,630
AUDIENCE: Could you
repeat the question?

512
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,560
PROFESSOR: Sure, yeah.

513
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,970
OK.

514
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,226
So we just did the problem,
we had a single mutant A

515
00:27:45,226 --> 00:27:47,350
and a single mutant B. And
we found the probability

516
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,980
that B fixes was 0.005.

517
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,540
Now I want to know
is, does anything

518
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,022
change instead of having
a single A and single B,

519
00:27:55,022 --> 00:27:59,910
now what we have is 10 A, 10 B,
and then the rest of them just

520
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,275
being [INAUDIBLE] one.

521
00:28:01,275 --> 00:28:14,620

522
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,890
So it's not fancy math.

523
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,765
But it's still, I can
see, a little confused.

524
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:35,857

525
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:37,440
I just wanted you
to see where we are.

526
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:44,264
We'll use the same options
here, whatever is closest.

527
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,430
And we can argue about what
close means in a moment.

528
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,715
All right, ready,
three, two, one.

529
00:28:49,715 --> 00:28:52,860

530
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:57,995
So it's kind of some
A's and B's, some E's.

531
00:28:57,995 --> 00:29:00,510

532
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,750
All right.

533
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,390
Well, we'll talk about it.

534
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,320

535
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,580
All right.

536
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,730
Maybe we'll jump ahead
to the group discussion,

537
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,430
just because I
don't want to spend

538
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,680
too much time on this problem.

539
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,420
But these are the
kinds of problems,

540
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,170
I think, it's very
important to practice with,

541
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,870
because they just
develop your intuition

542
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,119
for the stochastic dynamics
that occur in populations.

543
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:24,960

544
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,540
It's going to be something
like B. You know,

545
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,250
that's not why I put B in there.

546
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,580
But let's just see how it goes.

547
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,350
And the way to find
the answer here

548
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,580
is the same as what we did
before, except that now we

549
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,700
have to think about these
processes somewhat differently.

550
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,620
So first of all, in
order for B to fix,

551
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,630
it requires that still B has to
survive stochastic extinction.

552
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:52,514
So we still have
the same 0.01 here.

553
00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:54,430
But now we have to think
about the probability

554
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,980
that A doesn't survive.

555
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,270
And that's going to
change now, right?

556
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,660
Oh, I should be-- OK.

557
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,452
Yeah, OK.

558
00:30:05,452 --> 00:30:06,660
I forgot that we had 10 here.

559
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,522

560
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:12,730
We could calculate what it
is, and actually, maybe we

561
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,780
should have.

562
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,460
Well, let's calculate that.

563
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:21,440
All right, so this
is x1 for B. We still

564
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,560
have 1.01 to the
mill-- so we can still

565
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,029
ignore this bottom part.

566
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:28,570
But what it's going
to be is, oh, no,

567
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,380
but there's this x10 of B,
where you have 10 individuals.

568
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:38,295
So this is 1 minus
1.01 to the 10th power.

569
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,760
AUDIENCE: But we have
clonal interference here.

570
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,754

571
00:30:42,754 --> 00:30:44,920
PROFESSOR: Right now what
we're trying to understand

572
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:51,550
is if only we had B-- this
is the probability that we're

573
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,720
trying to calculate
this part of it.

574
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,770
So if we ignore A, what's
the probably that B

575
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,061
survives stochastic extinction?

576
00:30:57,061 --> 00:31:01,828

577
00:31:01,828 --> 00:31:04,840
Oh, this is fine.

578
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,460
So it's a modest change.

579
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:14,110
Because this is
going to be 1 minus.

580
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:27,180
So this thing is around 1.1,
because 1 plus x to the n

581
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:31,915
is around 1 plus nx for
nx much less than 1.

582
00:31:31,915 --> 00:31:35,070

583
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:48,110
So this is 1.1.

584
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,210
OK, so right.

585
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:55,300
So this is around 0.1.

586
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,850
So indeed, I'd forgotten
that there was 10.

587
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:04,010
So given that we have 10 of
these B individuals starting,

588
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:06,210
they may survive.

589
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,870
Ignoring A right now, just
on their own dynamics,

590
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:14,420
they may survive, or they may
drift down to 0 and go extinct.

591
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,690
And indeed, even starting
with 10 individuals--

592
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,330
10 B individuals-- you
actually still expect them

593
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,722
to go extinct.

594
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:22,260
And this, actually,
calculation is

595
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,392
very relevant for what
we're about to think about,

596
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:25,850
which is this
question of what does

597
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,855
it mean to be established
in a population.

598
00:32:27,855 --> 00:32:32,050
And already you can kind of
see what it's going to mean.

599
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,930
How big do you need to
get in the population

600
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,295
before you're likely to survive?

601
00:32:35,295 --> 00:32:38,300

602
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,200
AUDIENCE: 1/s.

603
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,161
PROFESSOR: 1/s.

604
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:41,536
Because you can
basically see how

605
00:32:41,536 --> 00:32:43,452
this is going to work
out in this calculation,

606
00:32:43,452 --> 00:32:47,090
that the number you have
to get to to be established

607
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,854
is around 1/s.

608
00:32:49,854 --> 00:32:52,270
So in this case, you have to
get to around 100 individuals

609
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,715
before you are going to be more
likely than not to survive.

610
00:32:55,715 --> 00:32:59,657

611
00:32:59,657 --> 00:33:01,490
Let's see if we can
figure out this problem.

612
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,130
All right, so we had
0.1 was the probability

613
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,010
that B would survive
stochastic extinction.

614
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,504
But then in order
for B to fix, it

615
00:33:07,504 --> 00:33:09,420
has to not only survive
stochastic extinction,

616
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,110
but also A has to not survive.

617
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:14,380

618
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,140
And we can figure out what
that is going to be here.

619
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,430
This is that term.

620
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:24,870
And then we need another one.

621
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,820
So this is x of 10 of
A. And this is, again,

622
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,370
going to be 1 minus
1/2 to the 10th power.

623
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,842
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

624
00:33:35,842 --> 00:33:36,800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

625
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,050
So it's always good to
memorize a few of these things.

626
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:45,740
2 to the 10 is
approximately 1,000.

627
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,680
But we want not this.

628
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,590
So we're going to
subtract this 1 away.

629
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,320
So we're going to get
10 to the minus 3.

630
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,070

631
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,790
Do you guys see
how that-- right?

632
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:00,013
So given that we start
with 10 individuals of A

633
00:34:00,013 --> 00:34:02,552
with a relative fitness
2, then there's only a 1

634
00:34:02,552 --> 00:34:04,950
in 1,000 chance that
those A individuals

635
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,300
are going to go extinct.

636
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:14,409

637
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:17,040
So the probability that B is
going to fix in this situation

638
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,750
is rather close to
10 to the minus 4.

639
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,460
So it's somewhere
in between there.

640
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:28,740

641
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,299
Are there any questions
about how that came about?

642
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:34,879

643
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,920
I feel like there's a fair
amount of unhappiness.

644
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:51,530

645
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,260
So it could be
the logic of this,

646
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,510
or it could be the calculation
of one of the two terms

647
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,210
or it could be something else.

648
00:34:59,210 --> 00:34:59,710
Yes?

649
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,376
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

650
00:35:00,376 --> 00:35:03,686
Where did you get
x10 B, the probably

651
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:07,336
of x of B surviving again?

652
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:09,460
PROFESSOR: You want to know
this term or that term?

653
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,501
AUDIENCE: The first term.

654
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:12,120
PROFESSOR: Right,
the first term.

655
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,190
So the first term
is just asking,

656
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:18,240
if there were no A, what would
be the probability that B would

657
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,490
survive stochastic extinction?

658
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:23,010
That's the same as the
probability that it would fix,

659
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:25,060
because it's a
beneficial mutation,

660
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,846
and if B is the
only thing, right?

661
00:35:26,846 --> 00:35:27,846
So we use this equation.

662
00:35:27,846 --> 00:35:29,862
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

663
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:31,320
PROFESSOR: So we
use this equation,

664
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,140
except that this
thing just goes to 1,

665
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,470
so we're just left with this.

666
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,714
But this equation is
assuming that there's

667
00:35:36,714 --> 00:35:38,172
just one of the
mutant individuals.

668
00:35:38,172 --> 00:35:44,050
Otherwise if you say x sub
i, then it's r to the i here.

669
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:50,474

670
00:35:50,474 --> 00:35:52,640
So that was the equation
that was derived in chapter

671
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,275
six of Evolutionary Dynamics.

672
00:35:54,275 --> 00:35:57,780

673
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,670
But I think that that's not
the only thing that people are

674
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:10,511
unhappy about, so please-- no?

675
00:36:10,511 --> 00:36:11,010
Yes.

676
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,551
AUDIENCE: A question
on why don't you

677
00:36:12,551 --> 00:36:14,398
need to take into
account B doesn't

678
00:36:14,398 --> 00:36:16,818
survive-- that probability
that B doesn't survive?

679
00:36:16,818 --> 00:36:19,234
For that first question that's
not on the board right now,

680
00:36:19,234 --> 00:36:23,084
I guess, for the nearly
neutral [INAUDIBLE].

681
00:36:23,084 --> 00:36:25,500
PROFESSOR: OK, so this was the
very first one that we did?

682
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,574
OK.

683
00:36:26,574 --> 00:36:27,740
Right, so you want to know--

684
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,532

685
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:32,740
AUDIENCE: Why don't you need
to take into account the

686
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,880
probably that B doesn't survive?

687
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,588
PROFESSOR: All right,
so in this problem,

688
00:36:35,588 --> 00:36:39,700
it's just that they all behave
as if they were just neutral.

689
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,390
So the probability of each of
these 10 individuals fixing

690
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,520
in the population is
the same, essentially.

691
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,460
So they each have a 1 in 10
probability of surviving.

692
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,770
And in this case, I
would say that if things

693
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,040
are nearly neutral,
you don't talk

694
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,200
about this idea of surviving
stochastic extinction,

695
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,730
because you can't get
big enough to the point

696
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,644
where you are really
guaranteed to survive

697
00:37:06,644 --> 00:37:07,560
stochastic extinction.

698
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,610
Because even if you've gone to
occupy 75% of the population,

699
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,610
what's your probability
of fixing at that stage?

700
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:16,350

701
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:20,310
If you're nearly neutral
and you get up to 75%,

702
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,690
you have a 75% chance of fixing.

703
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,790

704
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,170
In the case in the
neutral mutations,

705
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,750
there's no analogous
idea of what

706
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,510
it means to be established,
because you could always

707
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,850
just go back and go extinct
with finite probability.

708
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:42,800

709
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,415
This question?

710
00:37:43,415 --> 00:37:47,350

711
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:50,300
Well, it's looking more
and more likely to show up

712
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,980
on the midterm in two weeks.

713
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,972
So now is your opportunity
to ask a question about it.

714
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:02,870
AUDIENCE: Can you talk
about and establish

715
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:03,980
how you got [INAUDIBLE]?

716
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,650
PROFESSOR: Yes.

717
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,320
OK, this is a good question.

718
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,230
So when we talk about a mutation
becoming established, that's

719
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:18,310
asking-- of course, we know
that even a rather beneficial

720
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,810
mutation, say
something that confers

721
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:24,520
advantage of a few percent,
will probably go extinct.

722
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,150
However, if it gets up to
be a large enough fraction

723
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,745
or a number of the
population, then the dynamics

724
00:38:31,745 --> 00:38:34,120
are going to be well described
by a differential equation

725
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,810
where it won't go extinct.

726
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:39,990
So this is established mutation.

727
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,060
And this, again, we
really talk about only

728
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,392
for beneficial mutations,
because other mutations

729
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:46,600
can't really get established.

730
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,210
They could still
stochastically fix.

731
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,775
But it's still stochastic
up to the very end.

732
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:54,640

733
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,605
And so the question is, at
what number in the population

734
00:38:58,605 --> 00:39:01,750
do you had to get before you
are expected to take over

735
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:06,050
the population, assuming that
other new mutants don't arise.

736
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:13,650

737
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,260
That corresponds
to asking, OK, this

738
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,718
is the probability
of fixation when

739
00:39:16,718 --> 00:39:21,330
you have i individuals
in the population.

740
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:24,060
And this is what we saw before.

741
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:28,720

742
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,280
This is permutation
with relative fitness r.

743
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,940
You have i individuals in the
population, total population

744
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,700
size n.

745
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,140

746
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,300
And this becoming
established means that xi

747
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,720
is approximately equal to 1.

748
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:49,850

749
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:53,480
Now, in these
situations, r to the n

750
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,199
is, again, very, very large.

751
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:56,365
So this thing we can ignore.

752
00:39:56,365 --> 00:39:58,840
So this is really the same
thing as asking that 1 minus.

753
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,870

754
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,530
And this never gets to
be exactly equal to 1.

755
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,360
But what now we're
really asking is

756
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,770
that this thing is close to 1.

757
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,970

758
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,470
And this equivalent
is saying that--

759
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:17,120
what do we want to say--
that 1 over r to the i

760
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,390
is much less than 1.

761
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:24,760

762
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,930
And well, that means that r to
the i is much greater than 1.

763
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:39,240

764
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,050
So this is really saying
that what you want

765
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,740
is i times s to be
much greater than 1.

766
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:51,432

767
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:54,980
So n established,
which is, in this case,

768
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,575
it's the i such
that this is true.

769
00:40:56,575 --> 00:41:00,910

770
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,850
It has to be much
greater than 1 over s.

771
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:06,010

772
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:17,870
And indeed, I think that when
i is equal to 1 over s, then

773
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,500
I think the probability
of extinction is 1 over e,

774
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,950
if you do the math.

775
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:27,050
So that means that this is kind
of the crossing over point,

776
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,320
where you're more likely
than not to survive.

777
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,290

778
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,690
And just to be concrete,
for many of the mutations

779
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,440
we're talking about and that
you read about in Roy's paper,

780
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,170
s was a few percent.

781
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,450
So this is saying that the
population is established

782
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,860
when the number of these
mutants gets up to above 30

783
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,750
or a few times 30, so
maybe 100 individuals

784
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,220
means that it's unlikely to
go extinct stochastically.

785
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:58,930

786
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,690
So really, it's once you
get to this n established,

787
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,610
then the population
will grow exponentially

788
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,390
in the population.

789
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,347
And it's going to
spread exponentially

790
00:42:07,347 --> 00:42:09,805
with an advantage s relative
to the rest of the population.

791
00:42:09,805 --> 00:42:13,309

792
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:15,850
So this discussion is actually
very useful for the next thing

793
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:16,766
we want to talk about.

794
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:18,890
But are there any question
about how we got this?

795
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:22,741

796
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:24,866
AUDIENCE: You said the
probability of going extinct

797
00:42:24,866 --> 00:42:26,870
is 1 over e.

798
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,230
PROFESSOR: Right

799
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,370
AUDIENCE: So xi is
approximately equal to 1.

800
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,482

801
00:42:32,482 --> 00:42:33,190
PROFESSOR: Right.

802
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:38,064
So this is the probably
of going extinct?

803
00:42:38,064 --> 00:42:39,800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

804
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,910
PROFESSOR: So the probability
of going extinct here,

805
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:47,583
if you have i individuals,
is 1 over this guy.

806
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:52,330
So it's 1 over 1
plus s to the i.

807
00:42:52,330 --> 00:43:02,930
And then if i times s
is 1 but s is small--

808
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:07,030
this is one of those
definitions of e to the x

809
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:09,470
that, I don't know, do
you guys remember this?

810
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:15,390
It's like, oh my goodness,
e to the x is the limit.

811
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:22,449

812
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:26,390
No, no, x is up there.

813
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,810
Boy, you guys are taxing me.

814
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,210
All right.

815
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:34,010
This is x over n to the n.

816
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,900
And this limit is
n goes to infinity.

817
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,440
Is this?

818
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,237
AUDIENCE: Yes.

819
00:43:38,237 --> 00:43:39,195
PROFESSOR: Do we agree?

820
00:43:39,195 --> 00:43:39,695
OK.

821
00:43:39,695 --> 00:43:42,350

822
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,488
This makes sense, right?

823
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:47,264

824
00:43:47,264 --> 00:43:48,930
So this is just the
equivalent of saying

825
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:52,110
that if i times s equal
to 1 but s is small,

826
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,110
then this thing is around e.

827
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:58,569

828
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:00,610
If you're confused, I
don't want to get into this

829
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,060
too much, because it's
not quite central to what

830
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:02,640
we're talking about.

831
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,640
But come up and talk
to me after the class,

832
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,800
and we'll derive this together.

833
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,050

834
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:15,500
So the idea is that when you've
reached a population size of 1

835
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,297
over s, then you have a 1 over
e probability of going extinct.

836
00:44:19,297 --> 00:44:22,160

837
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,510
So e pops up at all
sorts of weird locations.

838
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:27,800
This is why you hear about it.

839
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,084

840
00:44:33,084 --> 00:44:34,500
So what I want to
do now is I want

841
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,330
to discuss this idea of clonal
interference a little bit more,

842
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:41,850
in particular ask, in
what situation will

843
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:44,270
we have clonal interference?

844
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:47,010
Or equivalently, when can we
ignore clonal interference?

845
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:51,180

846
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,290
Can somebody say
in words when we're

847
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,870
going to be able to ignore the
effect of clonal interference?

848
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:58,693
Yes.

849
00:44:58,693 --> 00:45:02,477
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] so large
that there's a very limited

850
00:45:02,477 --> 00:45:04,954
match that goes to--

851
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:06,370
PROFESSOR: OK, I
think we're going

852
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,750
to have to be careful here.

853
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,510
Because you're saying, oh
well, if the population

854
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,580
is large enough,
then you're saying,

855
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,370
oh, the mutations
won't interact, right?

856
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:17,140
AUDIENCE: Not in the beginning.

857
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:17,250
PROFESSOR: Right.

858
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,791
They don't interact
at the beginning.

859
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:21,220
I think that statement
I'm very happy with.

860
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,840
But the problem is that
if they both survive

861
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,170
stochastic extinction
and they start spreading,

862
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:32,020
then they do start to interact
in this large population.

863
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,962
AUDIENCE: Didn't you
just say that once they

864
00:45:33,962 --> 00:45:37,892
survive stochastic extinction,
they pretty much behave like--

865
00:45:37,892 --> 00:45:39,600
PROFESSOR: They behave
deterministically.

866
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,530
But the thing is that if you
have two sub-populations that

867
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,520
are exponentially
growing-- and there

868
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,390
are these very nice diagrams
that I guess in Roy's paper

869
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:48,530
they don't show.

870
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:56,060
Which is if you look at somehow
the population kind of changing

871
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:02,970
as a function of time, you can
think about, OK, well, this

872
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,630
is, let's say, constant
population size.

873
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:09,610
And it starts out all
being a particular type.

874
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:12,480
We'll say there's
some population of A.

875
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,094
But now a new mutation
arises and survives

876
00:46:15,094 --> 00:46:16,010
stochastic extinction.

877
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,196
It starts spreading
in the population.

878
00:46:18,196 --> 00:46:22,840
All right, this may
be mutant B. But then

879
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:28,110
if another mutant appears over
here that's even more fit,

880
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:32,160
then it can actually
spread faster.

881
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:39,520
And indeed, it can cause the
B lineage to get out competed.

882
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:45,950
So we start out with population
A. Mutant B is more fit than A.

883
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,660
It's spreading exponentially.

884
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:51,230
But some time later
mutation C appears.

885
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,810
Now this C lineage
is more fit than B,

886
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,390
so it's able to
spread exponentially.

887
00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:02,900
And indeed, it out competes
B. So this is exactly what

888
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,220
we mean by clonal interference.

889
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,500
These two lineages are
interfering with each other.

890
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,550
So this is, indeed,
clonal interference.

891
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:14,305
And there have been
these drawings out.

892
00:47:14,305 --> 00:47:16,680
For every 20 years, people
have been thinking about this.

893
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,540
Like Lenski wrote some classic
papers thinking about this.

894
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,962
Recently, Michael
Desai at Harvard

895
00:47:22,962 --> 00:47:24,420
has done some really
beautiful work

896
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,200
where he takes these
evolving yeast populations.

897
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,685
He does high
resolution-- resolution

898
00:47:30,685 --> 00:47:33,230
in both senses,
temporal as well as

899
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:36,060
kind of deep sequencing in the
population-- where he could

900
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:40,060
actually directly see these
lineages spreading and then

901
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,030
being out-competed.

902
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,737
And he sees multiple
mutations spreading

903
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:45,570
through the population
together because they

904
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:46,778
were attached on some genome.

905
00:47:46,778 --> 00:47:50,670
It's a very nice paper.

906
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:53,200
I almost had you guys
read it, so it's maybe

907
00:47:53,200 --> 00:48:02,637
Nature in 2012, '13.

908
00:48:02,637 --> 00:48:04,480
I don't know, possibly '12.

909
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,240

910
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,040
So this is the idea of
clonal interference.

911
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,404
So it's after the initial
stochastic dynamics

912
00:48:13,404 --> 00:48:14,070
have played out.

913
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:14,914
Yes.

914
00:48:14,914 --> 00:48:18,232
AUDIENCE: Is the [? spectre ?]
[INAUDIBLE] you call that

915
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:20,510
[? clonal ?] [? interference? ?]

916
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:23,010
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so that is a
result of clonal interference,

917
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:27,990
because it's saying that that
half arises because B, maybe,

918
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:30,900
if it did survive, it may
still get out-competed by A.

919
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,083
So that's clonal interference.

920
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:35,166
AUDIENCE: Did you say the
populations of mutations

921
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:36,532
weren't [? correct? ?]

922
00:48:36,532 --> 00:48:37,240
PROFESSOR: Right.

923
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,390
So the idea is that they
don't interact initially.

924
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:42,000
Because when the mutations
are present at a very low

925
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,660
frequency, then they're
really interacting

926
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:49,010
with the bulk, the rest of the
population, 10 to the 6 there.

927
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,970
However, if they survive
stochastic extinction

928
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,020
and they start spreading
in the population,

929
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,998
then there's the possibility
of clonal interference.

930
00:48:56,998 --> 00:49:00,097
AUDIENCE: But wouldn't that
change that [INAUDIBLE]?

931
00:49:00,097 --> 00:49:00,680
PROFESSOR: No.

932
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,800
I think that's why
it's at the half.

933
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,150
Because this factor of a
half is really just saying

934
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:10,250
that even if B survives
stochastic extinction,

935
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,270
it only has a 50-50
shot of actually being

936
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:15,037
able to take over, because
there's a 50% chance

937
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:16,870
it's going to experience
clonal interference

938
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,994
with this A lineage that's
going to out-compete it.

939
00:49:18,994 --> 00:49:26,770

940
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:30,971
Maybe if you're unhappy
about that statement,

941
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:31,845
harass me afterwards.

942
00:49:31,845 --> 00:49:36,050

943
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:39,060
So from this
discussion, though, how

944
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,642
can we think about
the importance

945
00:49:40,642 --> 00:49:41,600
of clonal interference?

946
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,670
In particular, there are
going to be two time scales.

947
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:47,149
And the question
of whether there's

948
00:49:47,149 --> 00:49:48,940
going to be significant
clonal interference

949
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:53,070
is related to which of
these time scales is larger.

950
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:54,975
So what might the
time scales be?

951
00:49:54,975 --> 00:50:12,507

952
00:50:12,507 --> 00:50:13,965
Or at least one of
the time scales?

953
00:50:13,965 --> 00:50:18,676

954
00:50:18,676 --> 00:50:20,217
AUDIENCE: I guess
one should probably

955
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:21,952
be the time to be established.

956
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:22,660
PROFESSOR: Right.

957
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,270
To be established.

958
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:26,914
AUDIENCE: To reach the
[INAUDIBLE] [? establish. ?]

959
00:50:26,914 --> 00:50:27,580
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

960
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:33,405

961
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:37,210
So the actual time that it takes
from when a mutation appears

962
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:42,600
to when it becomes established--
I mean, there is a time there.

963
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,540
But it ends up not being
the relevant thing,

964
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,130
because that's the regime
where they're not actually

965
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:50,550
interacting, that the
mutant lineages are not

966
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,030
interacting anyways.

967
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:53,950
So there's a sense
that it doesn't quite

968
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:58,206
matter how long that takes,
at least to first order.

969
00:50:58,206 --> 00:51:03,036
AUDIENCE: How much time did it
take to reach some population

970
00:51:03,036 --> 00:51:06,132
size [INAUDIBLE]?

971
00:51:06,132 --> 00:51:06,840
PROFESSOR: Right.

972
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,680
OK, yeah.

973
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,380
So one of them is
going to be that it's

974
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:16,200
the time to go from
established to fixation.

975
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,992
So it's actually the
next time scale there.

976
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,699
And actually, the time
to get established

977
00:51:19,699 --> 00:51:20,770
is actually rather short.

978
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:23,240

979
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,740
So a mutation appears, and most
of the time it goes extinct.

980
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,531
But the ones that don't
go extinct actually

981
00:51:27,531 --> 00:51:29,570
get established rather
quickly, because that's

982
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:33,190
a biased sampling
over the trajectories.

983
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:35,360
But there is a rather
significant time

984
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,192
that it takes for
the lineage to go

985
00:51:37,192 --> 00:51:38,900
from being established
to actually fixing

986
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,710
in the population.

987
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:42,300
So this is kind of how long
it takes for a mutation

988
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,220
to take over a population.

989
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,500
We might call this the
time to spread or so.

990
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,870

991
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,920
And it turns out
that that time--

992
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,710
what is it going to depend on?

993
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:56,489
AUDIENCE: s.

994
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:58,030
PROFESSOR: It's
going to depend on s.

995
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:04,610
So as s goes up,
then this goes down.

996
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:05,410
All right, perfect.

997
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:09,124
All right, let's just
go put a 1 over s there.

998
00:52:09,124 --> 00:52:11,290
And this is because it's
going to grow exponentially

999
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:13,190
in the population.

1000
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:15,560
And then how else is
it going to depend on?

1001
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,860
AUDIENCE: n.

1002
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,100
PROFESSOR: n, right.

1003
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:22,980
And indeed, this is going
to be the log of n times s.

1004
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,460
It's really n over
n established.

1005
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,280
Because the idea is that you
start out at n established.

1006
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,920
You grow exponentially with
rate s until you kind of take

1007
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,780
over the population, size n.

1008
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,215

1009
00:52:36,215 --> 00:52:41,846
And this s appears because
it's 1 over n established.

1010
00:52:41,846 --> 00:52:44,230
Because this in the log
is really the population

1011
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:45,480
size divided by n established.

1012
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,030

1013
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:50,470
So this is one time scale.

1014
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:52,810
Do you guys understand why
it should be like this?

1015
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:57,060

1016
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:57,560
Right.

1017
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,768
And what's the other time
scale that's relevant here?

1018
00:52:59,768 --> 00:53:03,530
AUDIENCE: How fast
mutations occur.

1019
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:06,536
PROFESSOR: How fast
mutations-- yes.

1020
00:53:06,536 --> 00:53:08,744
AUDIENCE: How long you have
to wait from one mutation

1021
00:53:08,744 --> 00:53:09,950
to the next mutation.

1022
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:10,770
PROFESSOR: Right.

1023
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:14,370
So this is how long you have
to wait for one mutation.

1024
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:20,290
So this is T, what we
might call T mutation.

1025
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:21,850
Now it's a little
bit subtle to think

1026
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:25,440
about what this should be.

1027
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,940
But it should say
something about the time

1028
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:32,216
it takes for mutations to
appear in the population.

1029
00:53:32,216 --> 00:53:36,430
So let's go ahead and just
guess what this might be.

1030
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:38,720
T mutation should
be equal to what?

1031
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,380
All right, so it could be--

1032
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:45,800

1033
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,716
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1034
00:53:46,716 --> 00:53:52,754

1035
00:53:52,754 --> 00:53:53,420
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1036
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,650
So I guess I'm trying to get you
to think about what this should

1037
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,860
mean to be relevant for
determining the time

1038
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,022
scales of whether clonal
interference is important.

1039
00:54:02,022 --> 00:54:04,170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1040
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:08,820
PROFESSOR: Mu is the
probability per generation

1041
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:13,020
of having a beneficial
mutation of magnitude s.

1042
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:18,764
Mu is kind of the mutation rate.

1043
00:54:18,764 --> 00:54:20,442
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1044
00:54:20,442 --> 00:54:21,150
PROFESSOR: Right.

1045
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:23,839
But we'll just
assume that there's

1046
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,380
only one kind of
beneficial mutation,

1047
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,550
and every beneficial
mutation has magnitude s,

1048
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:30,990
for simplicity.

1049
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:32,960
So it's mutation rate.

1050
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,430
It's a beneficial mutation
rate per generation

1051
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:36,965
of leading to mutation s.

1052
00:54:36,965 --> 00:54:43,040

1053
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,720
And you can just also say,
if you have no idea what

1054
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,160
I'm talking about, it's fine.

1055
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,890
But it's worth spending a
little bit of time thinking

1056
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,880
about what should
be the relevant time

1057
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,466
scale to compare to this.

1058
00:54:57,466 --> 00:54:57,965
Yes?

1059
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:00,212
AUDIENCE: So Mu is per
organism [INAUDIBLE]?

1060
00:55:00,212 --> 00:55:03,156

1061
00:55:03,156 --> 00:55:04,156
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1062
00:55:04,156 --> 00:55:16,990

1063
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:18,970
And it's OK if you
find this confusing,

1064
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:20,200
because this is subtle.

1065
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,380
But if you think about
it for 30 seconds, then

1066
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:27,220
maybe you'll be fertile ground
for the discussion to follow.

1067
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:47,392

1068
00:55:47,392 --> 00:55:49,920
All right, let's go ahead and
vote and see where we are.

1069
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,220
Ready, three, two, one.

1070
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,020

1071
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,260
All right.

1072
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,850
This is very nice.

1073
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:05,748
Almost everybody is saying C.
Although it really should be D.

1074
00:56:05,748 --> 00:56:06,664
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1075
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:09,800

1076
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,594
So 1 over s is units of time,
and 1 over mu is [INAUDIBLE].

1077
00:56:12,594 --> 00:56:15,790

1078
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:19,110
PROFESSOR: OK, that's an
interesting statement.

1079
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,730
I mean, I guess this
is a relative fitness.

1080
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:22,690
AUDIENCE: So s is mu.

1081
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:23,279

1082
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:25,070
AUDIENCE: But right
there, you have s units

1083
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:29,000
of time, 1/s units of time.

1084
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,625
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
the problem of this

1085
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:33,525
is this is all in units
of generation time.

1086
00:56:33,525 --> 00:56:34,900
Because this is
really telling us

1087
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,233
about the number of generations.

1088
00:56:36,233 --> 00:56:39,970

1089
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:45,379
So what is going on?

1090
00:56:45,379 --> 00:56:47,420
Because 1 over mu n should
also be a time, right?

1091
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,990

1092
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:50,906
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1093
00:56:50,906 --> 00:57:00,800

1094
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,380
Yeah, I'm not sure
if-- yeah, I mean,

1095
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,754
since this is all
in generations,

1096
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:11,550
I'm not sure if we even have
to-- yeah, I think it's OK.

1097
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:13,494
AUDIENCE: n times s
has to be [INAUDIBLE].

1098
00:57:13,494 --> 00:57:16,410

1099
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:18,880
PROFESSOR: I like
that statement.

1100
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,100
But then he, I mean--

1101
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,940
AUDIENCE: Well, then
you have 1 over mu.

1102
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,939
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I know.

1103
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,845
But then, this should
have units of time.

1104
00:57:25,845 --> 00:57:29,520
I agree with your statement, but
I also sort of agree with his,

1105
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,520
the 1 over s here.

1106
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,190
You know that's the problem.

1107
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:32,130
AUDIENCE: Everything
is basically unitless.

1108
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:33,630
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but I
think that it's really

1109
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:35,463
because everything's
in units of generation.

1110
00:57:35,463 --> 00:57:37,300
So really, it's all
unitless, except for mu.

1111
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,166
Yeah.

1112
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,541
AUDIENCE: What I
don't understand

1113
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:44,462
is why how beneficial
the mutation is

1114
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:46,430
should play into how--

1115
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,860
PROFESSOR: No, I agree.

1116
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,900
This is subtle.

1117
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,460
So let's imagine this is time.

1118
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:55,700

1119
00:57:55,700 --> 00:58:01,330
Now, 1 over mu n is
telling us how much time

1120
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:03,660
there is between the
initial appearance

1121
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,994
of these beneficial mutants.

1122
00:58:06,994 --> 00:58:08,535
So here we get a
beneficial mutation.

1123
00:58:08,535 --> 00:58:10,484

1124
00:58:10,484 --> 00:58:12,150
But what do you think
is going to happen

1125
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,754
to that beneficial mutation?

1126
00:58:14,754 --> 00:58:15,670
Yeah, that guy's dead.

1127
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:18,709
It comes up.

1128
00:58:18,709 --> 00:58:21,250
How long do we have to wait for
the next beneficial mutation?

1129
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,280
AUDIENCE: 1 over mu n.

1130
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,238
PROFESSOR: 1 over mu n.

1131
00:58:23,238 --> 00:58:24,824
Is it going to be exactly that?

1132
00:58:24,824 --> 00:58:26,240
Is going to be
peaked around that?

1133
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,460

1134
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,790
All right, verbal
answer, what is

1135
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:34,070
going to be the
probability distribution

1136
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:38,490
between successive appearances
of this beneficial mutation?

1137
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:40,996
Ready, three, two, one.

1138
00:58:40,996 --> 00:58:41,912
AUDIENCE: Exponential.

1139
00:58:41,912 --> 00:58:44,130
PROFESSOR: It's
exponentially distributed.

1140
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:46,010
So there might be another one
that's coming through here.

1141
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,090
What do you think is going
to happen to that guy?

1142
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:47,842
AUDIENCE: Probably dead.

1143
00:58:47,842 --> 00:58:48,950
PROFESSOR: Oh, he's dead.

1144
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:50,330
OK.

1145
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:51,880
Another one.

1146
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,900
So these guys are appearing.

1147
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,360
But if the magnitude
of s is, say,

1148
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,770
0.02, that means we have to
wait for 50 of these things

1149
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,890
to appear before we
expect that one of them

1150
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:05,250
is actually going
to get established.

1151
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,460
And established means
it gets up to 1 over s.

1152
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:12,342

1153
00:59:12,342 --> 00:59:13,800
So this guy, once
he's established,

1154
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,560
he's going to grow
exponentially in the population.

1155
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:24,760
But the idea is that the time
scale here of 1 over mu n

1156
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,810
is the time between
successive appearances

1157
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:36,980
of this beneficial mutation,
whereas as 1 over mu ns

1158
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:41,030
is the time scale between
successive establishments

1159
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,380
of these beneficial mutations.

1160
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,921
And it's only if
they get established

1161
00:59:43,921 --> 00:59:47,060
that they're relevant.

1162
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:52,740
So that's why the t mutation
established is 1 over mu ns.

1163
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:56,320

1164
00:59:56,320 --> 01:00:02,710
Now, no clonal interference
means that one of these

1165
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:04,150
is larger than the other one.

1166
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:07,490

1167
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:10,340
So no clonal
interference means is it,

1168
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,470
A, this guy's larger,
or B, this guy's larger?

1169
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:16,370

1170
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:18,431
So larger, question mark.

1171
01:00:18,431 --> 01:00:18,930
This one?

1172
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:19,730
That one?

1173
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:21,521
All right, think about
this for 15 seconds,

1174
01:00:21,521 --> 01:00:24,160
just to make sure that
we're-- make sure.

1175
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,210
We're asking, if there's
no clonal interference,

1176
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:28,751
it means that one of these is
much larger than the other one.

1177
01:00:28,751 --> 01:00:29,350
Which one?

1178
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:34,140
Ready, three, two, one.

1179
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:39,370
It means that this thing is
much larger than this one.

1180
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:46,820
So this thing has to be much
larger than t establish to fix.

1181
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:49,980

1182
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,030
Because if it's the
case this time scale

1183
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:55,460
is very large compared to
this time scale of spreading,

1184
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:58,280
then the mutations don't
ever clonal interfere.

1185
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,840

1186
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,500
I think it's very important
that you can reconstruct

1187
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:08,230
this whole argument
because it has

1188
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:10,690
all the ingredients of
the dynamics in terms

1189
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:14,235
of stochastic, and
then deterministic.

1190
01:01:14,235 --> 01:01:16,930

1191
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:20,290
If you find this stuff
confusing, please

1192
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,940
go through it with a friend
or come to me after class.

1193
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:26,560

1194
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,570
So what we went to do
for the last 20 minutes

1195
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:32,680
is, then, talk
about Roy's paper.

1196
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:37,796
And I think that this paper
is interesting and subtle.

1197
01:01:37,796 --> 01:01:39,670
It's a little bit hard
to tell how much of it

1198
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:45,020
is an experimental kind of
straight up demonstration

1199
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:47,350
or how much of it is that
it's just a way of getting

1200
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:49,179
you to think new thoughts.

1201
01:01:49,179 --> 01:01:51,470
It certainly is a way to get
you to think new thoughts.

1202
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:54,990
At least I felt that it
had that effect on me,

1203
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:57,510
and that after
reading it, I just

1204
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:59,620
got very excited
about all the dynamics

1205
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:03,670
that were at play
here, and how out

1206
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:05,660
of the complexity of
this clonal interference

1207
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,270
process, maybe, in
some cases, there

1208
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:10,060
might be some even simpler
phenomenological type

1209
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,164
description of
what was going on.

1210
01:02:12,164 --> 01:02:14,580
But I think that what is very
interesting about that paper

1211
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:17,210
is this idea that what they
really wanted to measure

1212
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:19,140
was this probability
distribution

1213
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:22,200
of beneficial mutations.

1214
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,874
So what we mean by that is that
different beneficial mutations

1215
01:02:25,874 --> 01:02:27,040
will have different effects.

1216
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:36,790

1217
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:40,350
And in particular, you could
imagine a thought experiment

1218
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:43,480
where you take an E. coli cell.

1219
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:49,770
How big is the E.
coli genome roughly?

1220
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:52,685
And just like it's always good
to have guideposts for how long

1221
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,935
ago things happened, it's
also good to have guideposts

1222
01:02:54,935 --> 01:02:56,860
for things like it's
just good to have

1223
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:00,590
a few genome sizes memorized.

1224
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:02,300
Now does anybody know
the E. coli genome?

1225
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,474
AUDIENCE: 2,000 base pairs.

1226
01:03:04,474 --> 01:03:05,640
PROFESSOR: 2,000 base pairs?

1227
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,485
AUDIENCE: 2,000 [INAUDIBLE].

1228
01:03:07,485 --> 01:03:10,330
PROFESSOR: No, I just want to
make sure that we're-- yeah.

1229
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:13,800
Yeah, it's a bit more than that.

1230
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,000
It's a few million base
pairs, three or four,

1231
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,100
depending on the strain.

1232
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:21,190
But you can imagine a thought
experiment where you go in,

1233
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:26,490
and at every base pair you
make the three possible point

1234
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:28,120
mutations.

1235
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,700
So then you can imagine having
10 million different strains

1236
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:35,020
that are each
different at one site.

1237
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:39,310
And then what we can do is we
can plot the rate of population

1238
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:41,510
growth in some environment.

1239
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:43,810
So this is gamma.

1240
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:51,040
It's the 1 over n dn/dt,
basically division, right?

1241
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:59,110
Normalized by the
wild type division.

1242
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:04,070
I'm sorry, that's
supposed to be down there.

1243
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:08,970
So this is gamma over
gamma of wild type.

1244
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:15,510
And this could be E. coli
in LB or minimal media or at

1245
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:16,040
30 [? ci ?].

1246
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:19,260
You pick some
reasonable environment.

1247
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,440
Question is, if you draw
the histogram of what

1248
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,265
this thing should look
like, what should it be?

1249
01:04:24,265 --> 01:04:29,390

1250
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:32,960
Now what I'm going to ask
you to do is, in 30 seconds,

1251
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,490
draw something on
your sheet of paper.

1252
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:38,014

1253
01:04:38,014 --> 01:04:39,430
This is supposed
to be a frequency

1254
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:45,107
or histogram over those 10
million point mutations.

1255
01:04:45,107 --> 01:04:46,940
So we haven't actually
done this experiment.

1256
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:54,160
But I think we have
made all possible gene

1257
01:04:54,160 --> 01:05:01,910
knockouts in E. coli, so
removing each of the genes.

1258
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:03,540
And we've done that in E. coli.

1259
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:04,822
We've done it in yeast.

1260
01:05:04,822 --> 01:05:07,280
And indeed, in yeast, they're
actually making and measuring

1261
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,270
the division rate for
all pairwise knockouts.

1262
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:14,600
So they're some fraction
of the way through.

1263
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,315
They published their first
10 million measurements

1264
01:05:17,315 --> 01:05:19,690
for the division rate of the
pairwise knockouts in yeast.

1265
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,350
This is Charlie
Boone at Toronto.

1266
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:23,630
It's an amazing data set.

1267
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:25,000
Sorry, this is a simpler one.

1268
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,850
So this is just if we make
a histogram of the growth

1269
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:33,530
rate of E. coli, all 10
million possible point

1270
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,279
mutations in E.
coli, what do you

1271
01:05:35,279 --> 01:05:36,528
think it's going to look like?

1272
01:05:36,528 --> 01:05:44,680

1273
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:49,380
And I'm going to come by, and if
I don't see distribution drawn

1274
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:53,300
on your sheet of
paper, then you'll

1275
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:56,825
get to draw it up here on
the board for all of us.

1276
01:05:56,825 --> 01:06:03,529

1277
01:06:03,529 --> 01:06:06,847
AUDIENCE: It's totally
a distribution.

1278
01:06:06,847 --> 01:06:07,430
PROFESSOR: OK.

1279
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:14,754

1280
01:06:14,754 --> 01:06:15,740
All right.

1281
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:19,009

1282
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:20,008
AUDIENCE: He was coming.

1283
01:06:20,008 --> 01:06:21,415
He was coming to me.

1284
01:06:21,415 --> 01:06:22,290
PROFESSOR: All right.

1285
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:24,248
And what I find interesting
about this exercise

1286
01:06:24,248 --> 01:06:26,440
is that you get all
possible distributions.

1287
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:30,276

1288
01:06:30,276 --> 01:06:34,530
No, but it's funny, because it's
like a super basic question.

1289
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:38,800
And somehow we don't necessarily
think about it, or whatnot.

1290
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,250
Could somebody
throw out what they

1291
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,976
think maybe should be going on?

1292
01:06:41,976 --> 01:06:42,928
Yeah.

1293
01:06:42,928 --> 01:06:46,736
AUDIENCE: So I'm expecting
a large fraction to get 0.

1294
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:52,410

1295
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:56,030
PROFESSOR: So it could
be that they're all here.

1296
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:59,036
AUDIENCE: You know, most will
start-- not most, but large

1297
01:06:59,036 --> 01:07:01,007
fractions [INAUDIBLE].

1298
01:07:01,007 --> 01:07:03,590
PROFESSOR: So it could be that
a large fraction of these point

1299
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:07,280
mutations, and the
cell is just dead.

1300
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,540
So this is what you call a
pessimistic view of nature

1301
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:11,740
or of life.

1302
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,970
And he has trouble crossing the
street because he's never sure.

1303
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:16,366
What do you think?

1304
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:21,159
AUDIENCE: I actually think that
there's a much larger fraction

1305
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:22,992
where it's exactly the
same, because they've

1306
01:07:22,992 --> 01:07:25,478
got a lot of point mutations
that are just substitutions.

1307
01:07:25,478 --> 01:07:26,311
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

1308
01:07:26,311 --> 01:07:28,970
So lots of them, maybe.

1309
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:31,630
So these are the two
polar views of the world,

1310
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:35,225
that nothing matters,
or you're all dead.

1311
01:07:35,225 --> 01:07:37,737

1312
01:07:37,737 --> 01:07:39,320
AUDIENCE: I think
it can reconcile it.

1313
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,240
I think you can say--

1314
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:45,040
PROFESSOR: OK, well, now I
think you're being too-- OK,

1315
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,510
how are we going
to reconcile them?

1316
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:48,551
AUDIENCE: So we know that
there's the [? third ?]

1317
01:07:48,551 --> 01:07:49,644
[? bubble, ?] right?

1318
01:07:49,644 --> 01:07:50,310
PROFESSOR: Sure.

1319
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:53,572
AUDIENCE: And so there's
probably at least 1/3

1320
01:07:53,572 --> 01:07:57,486
somewhere it just doesn't
matter at all, where

1321
01:07:57,486 --> 01:07:59,014
you get the same code.

1322
01:07:59,014 --> 01:08:00,930
PROFESSOR: Although there
are cases, actually,

1323
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:02,660
where even silent
mutations end up changing

1324
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:03,951
protein at an expression level.

1325
01:08:03,951 --> 01:08:07,056
All right, but I don't
know if this reconciles

1326
01:08:07,056 --> 01:08:08,180
the two views of the world.

1327
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:12,520

1328
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:18,135
So some people have drawn
things that look like this.

1329
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:21,090
Some people will draw it,
and things look like this.

1330
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:22,056
Yeah.

1331
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:23,514
And we have a
uniform distribution.

1332
01:08:23,514 --> 01:08:27,029

1333
01:08:27,029 --> 01:08:30,069
If you're going to make a null
model, I mean, I don't know.

1334
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:32,630
So I would say that we
have enough information

1335
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:35,290
to say something about what
this thing should look like.

1336
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:38,340

1337
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:43,695
So first of all, some fraction
of genes are indeed essential.

1338
01:08:43,695 --> 01:08:49,300

1339
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:53,430
For 10% or 20% of the genes,
you remove it, the cell is dead.

1340
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:56,340
That doesn't mean that 10%
to 20% of point mutations

1341
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:59,420
will lead to a lethal
phenotype, but it

1342
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:05,359
means that if you do inactivate
or knock out that gene,

1343
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:06,979
then it will be lethal.

1344
01:09:06,979 --> 01:09:12,547
So that means that there are
indeed some set of these point

1345
01:09:12,547 --> 01:09:14,130
mutations that are
going to be lethal,

1346
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:17,720
but it's going to be small.

1347
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,710
And I don't know what
the actual number

1348
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:29,040
would be, but maybe 1 in 10
to the 4, something small.

1349
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:34,270
Because it's probably only
10% the locations on the gene

1350
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,590
would actually knock it out.

1351
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:37,100
I'm making up that number.

1352
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:39,640
The protein guys would
have a much better sense.

1353
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,439
But it's going to
be a small number.

1354
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:43,410
It might only be 1% of
the mutations, actually,

1355
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:46,140
would actually knock out
the function of the protein.

1356
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:49,690
And then not all of the genome
actually codes for proteins.

1357
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:51,689
So you start multiplying
small numbers together,

1358
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:53,439
and you get something
that's rather small.

1359
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,810
But there will be some
number of mutations there.

1360
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:57,640
However, the vast
majority of mutations

1361
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,780
will have no measurable
fitness effect.

1362
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:06,600
So indeed, this thing kind
of peaks here, and then

1363
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,880
rather sharply comes down.

1364
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:12,440
And this is on a linear
scale, or something like that.

1365
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,680
So the width might
indeed be a few percent.

1366
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:20,210

1367
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:23,480
But actually, probably
even less, maybe 1%,

1368
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,182
or half, something small.

1369
01:10:26,182 --> 01:10:26,682
Yeah.

1370
01:10:26,682 --> 01:10:29,670
AUDIENCE: How skewed is it?

1371
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:32,205
PROFESSOR: So on a linear
scale, it doesn't look skewed.

1372
01:10:32,205 --> 01:10:34,120
On a log scale, I think it does.

1373
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,550
I mean, in the sense that
if you plot log frequency

1374
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:38,700
on this axis, then
there's a longer tail

1375
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,520
on the left than on the right.

1376
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:44,350
But I'd say on a linear scale,
it's just pretty sharp function

1377
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:44,850
there.

1378
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:46,475
AUDIENCE: So people
have measured that?

1379
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:47,990

1380
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:50,760
PROFESSOR: Certainly for
all the gene knockouts,

1381
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,080
we have measured this.

1382
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,980
And even that distribution
is sharply peaked.

1383
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:58,570
So the point mutation
distribution's

1384
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:00,926
going to be even
more tightly peaked.

1385
01:11:00,926 --> 01:11:02,509
AUDIENCE: For most
genes, you can just

1386
01:11:02,509 --> 01:11:04,284
knock them out and [INAUDIBLE].

1387
01:11:04,284 --> 01:11:04,950
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1388
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:05,450
Sorry.

1389
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:07,990
So for most genes, at least
in many environments--

1390
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:10,406
and of course, it depends on
what environment you measure.

1391
01:11:10,406 --> 01:11:12,420
But for most genes,
you can knock them out.

1392
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,670
Certainly in rich media,
most genes you can knock out.

1393
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:23,790

1394
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:31,400
This, as I said, might be
1 in 10 to the minus 3, 4.

1395
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,210

1396
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:37,770
I might be off by a couple
orders of magnitude.

1397
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:40,950
But the point is that this is
a small fraction over here.

1398
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:41,612
Most are here.

1399
01:11:41,612 --> 01:11:44,070
And there will be some point
mutations that come down here.

1400
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:46,210
But on a linear scale, it's
going to be very small.

1401
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:51,160

1402
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,270
Now from the standpoint
of a population evolving

1403
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:55,490
to a new environment,
which mutations

1404
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:57,292
are we most interested in?

1405
01:11:57,292 --> 01:11:58,600
AUDIENCE: The beneficial.

1406
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,099
PROFESSOR: The
beneficial mutations.

1407
01:12:00,099 --> 01:12:02,840
So we're most interested
in these guys.

1408
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,870

1409
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:09,250
And indeed, this
is the distribution

1410
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:14,120
that [INAUDIBLE] set out to try
and measure in that experiment

1411
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,180
that we just read
about last night.

1412
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:19,840
So he wanted to know,
if you zoom in here--

1413
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,400
because remember, this is even
narrower than I've actually

1414
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,400
drawn.

1415
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,320
But this distribution,
the probability

1416
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,110
of a beneficial mutation
of magnitude s-- s, here 0,

1417
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:36,555
s-- it's going to do something.

1418
01:12:36,555 --> 01:12:39,240

1419
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,915
Many mutations that
are nearly neutral,

1420
01:12:40,915 --> 01:12:42,540
but it's going to
fall off in some way,

1421
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,660
and they wanted to
try and measure this.

1422
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:48,190
Now how many mutations
confer a 2% advantage, 4%,

1423
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:49,690
for this particular
E. coli strain

1424
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:52,810
in that particular environment?

1425
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:55,874
But it turned out being
difficult to measure.

1426
01:12:55,874 --> 01:12:57,790
And what was the reason
that they gave for why

1427
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:58,956
it was difficult to measure?

1428
01:12:58,956 --> 01:13:06,000

1429
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,540
Somebody?

1430
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:07,201
Anybody?

1431
01:13:07,201 --> 01:13:07,700
Please?

1432
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:16,208

1433
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:17,124
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1434
01:13:17,124 --> 01:13:21,526

1435
01:13:21,526 --> 01:13:22,150
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1436
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:23,691
But the equivalence
principle doesn't

1437
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:26,860
say that they're all
equivalent necessarily.

1438
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:31,523
AUDIENCE: Well, you can
make different [INAUDIBLE].

1439
01:13:31,523 --> 01:13:33,064
So there are different
distributions,

1440
01:13:33,064 --> 01:13:35,530
and they each have
their perimeters

1441
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:36,199
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1442
01:13:36,199 --> 01:13:37,574
AUDIENCE: You can
pick perimeters

1443
01:13:37,574 --> 01:13:43,140
for each of them, such that
they will give you the same--

1444
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:44,570
PROFESSOR: OK, that's right.

1445
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:47,440
So what they found was
that different underlying

1446
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,724
distributions-- this
probability distribution

1447
01:13:50,724 --> 01:13:52,140
for beneficial
mutations, function

1448
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:55,200
of s-- different
underlying distributions

1449
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,570
could give you the same final
output in their measurements.

1450
01:13:58,570 --> 01:13:59,430
But why was that?

1451
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:05,850

1452
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:06,560
Yeah, John?

1453
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,162
AUDIENCE: The only thing you
can measure is what fixes.

1454
01:14:09,162 --> 01:14:09,870
PROFESSOR: Right.

1455
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:13,590
So you can only
measure what it fixes,

1456
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:17,130
or becomes significant
fraction population, 10%.

1457
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:18,805
Only measure what
fixes or grows.

1458
01:14:18,805 --> 01:14:22,520

1459
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,442
And what does that mean?

1460
01:14:25,442 --> 01:14:29,292
AUDIENCE: Well, it means that
you're not probing [INAUDIBLE].

1461
01:14:29,292 --> 01:14:30,000
PROFESSOR: Right.

1462
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,484
It means that we're not probing
that distribution, and why not?

1463
01:14:32,484 --> 01:14:33,400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1464
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,064

1465
01:14:36,064 --> 01:14:36,730
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1466
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:39,105
But why is it that we only
see part of this distribution?

1467
01:14:39,105 --> 01:14:40,520
What was their--

1468
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,510
AUDIENCE: We don't see
the ones that die out.

1469
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:44,426
PROFESSOR: We don't see
the ones that die out.

1470
01:14:44,426 --> 01:14:46,430
And why is that they die out?

1471
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:48,055
Or why is it that they--

1472
01:14:48,055 --> 01:14:49,270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1473
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:52,540
PROFESSOR: OK, yeah.

1474
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:53,200
Yes.

1475
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,699
So the fact of
stochastic extinction

1476
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:55,790
is very relevant here.

1477
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:57,790
And I think that in this
paper they a little bit

1478
01:14:57,790 --> 01:15:01,250
underplay that aspect of it,
because they're primarily

1479
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:03,410
arguing that it was
another effect that led

1480
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:05,680
to this equivalence principle.

1481
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:06,924
Right?

1482
01:15:06,924 --> 01:15:07,890
AUDIENCE: Competition.

1483
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:09,060
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
clonal interference.

1484
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:11,101
I mean, that's why we
spent the last hour talking

1485
01:15:11,101 --> 01:15:12,780
about clonal interference.

1486
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:14,870
So their argument
in this paper was

1487
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:16,950
that, as a result of
clonal interference,

1488
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:19,960
competition between
these different lineages,

1489
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:22,280
then the distribution
of fitness effects

1490
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,350
that you measure,
that fix, is not

1491
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:26,600
the distribution that was
the underlying distribution.

1492
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,210

1493
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:34,240
Because less fit beneficial
mutations get out-competed.

1494
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,850
But there's a very
important question,

1495
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:41,540
which is, let's imagine
that let's have mu go to 0.

1496
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:44,550

1497
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:46,060
Or we go to small populations.

1498
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:50,250
Let's say that after
reading his paper

1499
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:52,690
I said, OK, well, yeah,
because of clonal interference

1500
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:55,829
I can't measure this probability
distribution in the set up

1501
01:15:55,829 --> 01:15:56,370
that he used.

1502
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:59,300
But maybe if I go to
small population sizes,

1503
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:03,280
or I reduce the mutation
rate somehow-- magic--

1504
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:07,850
then would this allow me to
measure that distribution?

1505
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:09,470
So I'm going to ask
you guys to vote.

1506
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:10,370
So mu, let's say.

1507
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:12,470
Our experiment, I
have mu go to 0.

1508
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:16,990
Does this mean that when
I then go do write CFP,

1509
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:21,610
YFP, they're 50-50, and
then you start doing this.

1510
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:25,227
And we measure the
slope to get s,

1511
01:16:25,227 --> 01:16:26,435
just like in this experiment.

1512
01:16:26,435 --> 01:16:29,085

1513
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:38,100
If I plot the distribution
of resulting s's, no clonal

1514
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:41,660
interference anymore, because
I've set mu equal to 0.

1515
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:45,160
So this thing goes to infinity.

1516
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:50,710
Do I recover the
underlying distribution?

1517
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:51,710
Ready.

1518
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:57,210
So P be measured,
as a function of s,

1519
01:16:57,210 --> 01:17:00,380
is it equal to the true one?

1520
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:01,080
Question mark.

1521
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:07,770

1522
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:10,150
I'm going to give you 15
seconds to think about this.

1523
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:30,420

1524
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:31,350
Ready.

1525
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:35,150
Three, two, one.

1526
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:35,650
All right.

1527
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:38,880
So we have, I'd say,
a majority of nos.

1528
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,550
And can somebody say why not?

1529
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:43,540
AUDIENCE: You can't really
see the established mutation.

1530
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:44,540
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1531
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:47,130
Because even if you don't
have clonal interference,

1532
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,850
you still only see
the mutations that

1533
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:51,547
survive so stochastic
extinction.

1534
01:17:51,547 --> 01:17:53,380
And I think this is a
really important point

1535
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:55,338
that, at least in a first
reading of the paper,

1536
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:57,460
you might not realize.

1537
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:57,960
Yeah, John.

1538
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:58,876
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1539
01:17:58,876 --> 01:18:01,170

1540
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:02,170
PROFESSOR: That's right.

1541
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:05,300
So in principle, we know that
the probability of survival

1542
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,730
goes as s.

1543
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:10,460
But you end up losing a
fair amount of information.

1544
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:15,620
So for example, let's say that
this thing is an exponential.

1545
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,990
So this is Pb of s.

1546
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:21,180
Let's just say it's
an exponential.

1547
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:24,770
And indeed, from some ideas
from extreme value theory,

1548
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:28,226
there are arguments that maybe
this should be an exponential.

1549
01:18:28,226 --> 01:18:29,600
And if you're
curious about this,

1550
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,550
come and ask me after class.

1551
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:35,480
But let's just imagine that
this thing is exponential.

1552
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,420
Now the question is
what would we actually

1553
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:42,940
measure in this
experiment in the absence

1554
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:43,940
of clonal interference?

1555
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:47,870

1556
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:50,172
Would we measure
a distribution--

1557
01:18:50,172 --> 01:18:53,390
would the distribution
be maximal

1558
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:57,230
at 0 or at some other value?

1559
01:18:57,230 --> 01:18:58,690
Verbally, 0 or other value?

1560
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:00,804
Ready, three, two, one.

1561
01:19:00,804 --> 01:19:01,720
AUDIENCE: Other value.

1562
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:02,800
PROFESSOR: Other value.

1563
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,250
And indeed, the probability
of surviving extinction,

1564
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:10,170
remember this x1 goes as s
means that the distribution they

1565
01:19:10,170 --> 01:19:12,090
actually measure
will start at 0,

1566
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:19,750
grow linearly,
and then fall off.

1567
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,290
So this distribution
is essentially

1568
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:23,289
like this distribution
of the convolution of two

1569
01:19:23,289 --> 01:19:30,410
exponentials, where this
thing goes up linearly,

1570
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:33,580
and then curves off.

1571
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:37,240
So I think that a very important
point to realize in all of this

1572
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,370
is that this is probability
distribution that's

1573
01:19:39,370 --> 01:19:46,220
measured as a function of s with
no clonal interference, right?

1574
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,780
So the statement
is that even if you

1575
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,890
don't have any clonal
interference, already

1576
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,723
you're going to measure
a peak distribution.

1577
01:19:51,723 --> 01:19:56,760

1578
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:00,521
The underlying distribution
will be peaked at 0.

1579
01:20:00,521 --> 01:20:02,020
But what you measure
is always going

1580
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:02,930
to be peaked somewhere else.

1581
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:04,550
And indeed, if you
go and you look

1582
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:08,702
in the paper at the measured
alpha as a function of s,

1583
01:20:08,702 --> 01:20:10,660
you see something that
looks kind of like this.

1584
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:14,527
So it's a little bit difficult
to be absolutely certain.

1585
01:20:14,527 --> 01:20:17,110
What's going on is that in the
absence of clonal interference,

1586
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:17,700
you get this.

1587
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,160
With clonal interference, let's
say you have two mutations

1588
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,400
and you want to know, OK,
what are you going to measure?

1589
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,355
Well, you sample from
this distribution twice,

1590
01:20:23,355 --> 01:20:25,950
and you take the
larger of the two.

1591
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:27,910
Because this
distribution is already

1592
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:31,050
the probability distribution of
mutations that get established.

1593
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:35,495
So then this is going to
grow as a quadratic here.

1594
01:20:35,495 --> 01:20:37,040
If you have more
clonal interference,

1595
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:40,800
then this thing shifts to
the right and gets tighter.

1596
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,506
So this is the process
by which you end up

1597
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:44,630
with a peaked distribution.

1598
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:47,294

1599
01:20:47,294 --> 01:20:48,710
So what we're going
to do is we're

1600
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:53,050
going to start in the first
15 minutes on Tuesday.

1601
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:56,530
We'll talk about this
experiment a bit more.

1602
01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:59,440
And then we'll go on to think
about fitness landscapes

1603
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,930
and the rate of evolution.

1604
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:03,179
If you have any questions
about anything that we said,

1605
01:21:03,179 --> 01:21:03,941
please come on up.

1606
01:21:03,941 --> 01:21:04,441
